The European Turtle-dove Streptopelia turtur is a migratory game species that has declined in recent decades and for which identifying efficient and easy-to-apply monitoring schemes to assess changes in abundance is critical for adaptive management. We describe variation in cooing activity to help optimising Turtle Dove abundance monitoring schemes based on point-counts of cooing males. Cooing activity (number of minutes during a ten-minute sampling period when each Turtle Dove was cooing) declined markedly and linearly throughout the morning; in addition, it increased slightly from May to late June, and declined abruptly in the second half of July. The number of different turtle doves detected per ten-minute period significantly declined with time since dawn and was markedly lower after mid-July. Predicted abundance per observation point at dawn on 25 June (from a GLM per region including time and a quadratic relationship with date), correlated tightly (r = 0.95) with the average number of turtle doves detected at each point over multiple visits during the breeding season. Correlation of the latter with the number of birds observed in a single visit during the breeding period was weaker (0.68 ± 0.02). Estimated abundance per point was higher the longer the monitoring bout duration, but five-minute periods allowed detecting c. 80% of birds detected during ten-minute periods. To optimize Turtle Dove abundance monitoring schemes based on abundance indices, we suggest implementing fiveminute samplings from mid-May to mid-July during the first three hours after dawn, and transforming the observed values into predicted values considering the date and time at which surveys were made, to obtain comparable results across observation points and years.",actividad de canto; patrones diurnos; patrones estacionales; Streptopelia turtur,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/supplementary-electronic-material-rp-2-arroyo-et-al_1678782405.pdf,July 2023,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/702/articles/151-168/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/supplementary-electronic-material-rp-2-arroyo-et-al_1678782405.pdf

RENDÓN; , Juan A. AMAT; Gustavo LIÑÁN-CEMBRANO",,"Predation is one of the main causes of nest failure in birds. In order to overcome this, many species lay cryptic eggs, which enhances camouflage through either background matching or shape disruption, among other mechanisms. Despite this, ground-nesting birds still suffer high nest predation rates. One possibility to alleviate this could be to soil the eggs with particles of material surrounding nests, improving the camouflage. Indeed, it has been suggested that egg soiling is a mechanism of egg protection, but it remains to be demonstrated whether egg soiling is a strategy used by birds or is an unintentional by-product after incubating adults enter nests with dirty feet, legs and/or plumage. In this study, we analysed images from infra-red camera traps placed beside Pied Avocet Recurvirostra avosetta nests, in which we had previously cleaned dirty eggs and provided mud with which the adults might have soiled the eggs, and we found no evidence of deliberate egg soiling in this case. There was a slight improvement (not statistically significant) in the camouflage of soiled avocet eggs in comparison to clean eggs, but only in one of two studied nesting sites in which the eggs were more soiled. Although egg soiling may result in improved camouflage, future studies should address its potential costs to establish why it has not apparently evolved as a deliberate strategy to improve egg camouflage in nesting shorebirds.",crypsis; mud covering; shorebirds; texture analysis; visual modelling,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/supplementary-electronic-material-rp-2_1680591483.pdf,July 2023,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/702/articles/169-184/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/supplementary-electronic-material-rp-2_1680591483.pdf

Different reasons for the decline are discussed, including biotic interactions and climate change. It is evident that many studies have been conducted in populations depending completely on nest boxes, but the influence of this artificial support on population dynamics is not well understood. We investigated the population dynamics of the Pied Flycatcher in the Kottenforst, an old-growth forest in western Germany, using recent data as well as historical records. We also determined the proportion of pairs breeding in nest boxes vs. natural nesting places. Specifically, we quantitatively analysed forest structure around tree holes occupied by the pied flycatcher. We found a continuous increase in population size since its establishment in the 1960s, which contrasts with overall long-term population trends in Europe as well as the regional trend. Whereas importance of nest boxes decreased over recent years, the majority of pairs are occupying tree holes for breeding, which are abundant in the richly structured, open old-growth forest. This forest structure seems to be optimal for the Pied Flycatcher since it allows flying insects to be hunted close to the nest. Finally, we discuss how forest structure and age as well as tree hole and insect availability may determine population trends of the Pied Flycatcher and highlight the importance of long-term studies.",Bird monitoring; citizen science; climate change; food availability; forest structure; habitat conservation; Muscicapidae; nest box; tree hole,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/supplementary-electronic-material-rp-3-ardeola-702_1682590436.pdf,July 2023,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/702/articles/185-200/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/supplementary-electronic-material-rp-3-ardeola-702_1682590436.pdf

We focused on analysing body size differences between Yellow-legged gulls Larus michahellis from Mediterranean and Cantabrian-Atlantic Iberian colonies as previous studies have suggested that Cantabrian-Atlantic gulls are smaller than Mediterranean gulls. However, those analyses were based on small sample sizes or did not account for sexual dimorphism. Here we analyse an extensive biometric data set (> 1,500 adult individuals), separating males and females, from nine different sites in each region. Our results reveal a 7% (median) difference both between regions and sexes, for most morphometric variables, with Mediterranean gulls having longer legs (tarsi) and heads (cranium-bill) and thicker bills (bill-depth). This inter-regional difference was even larger for body mass, Mediterranean gulls being 11% (males) and 20% (females) heavier than Cantabrian-Atlantic gulls. In particular, we found that individuals from the Mediterranean populations were allometrically longer-winged than their northern counterparts. We suggest, after discarding other factors, that this wing allometry may be related to the sedentariness of the Cantabrian-Atlantic gulls, compared with the partially migratory strategy of Mediterranean gulls. We also suggest that the larger body size of Mediterranean gulls may help them compete better with resident gulls for food acquisition, once they coincide in the Cantabrian-Atlantic region. Finally, females from both populations were also found to be proportionately longerwinged than males. We hypothesise that this difference could allow smaller females to travel longer distances locally in search of food or to make use of different habitat types, avoiding foraging competition with the larger males.",adaptation; allometry; biometry; migration; oceanographic conditions; sexual dimorphism,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/supplementary-electronic-material-final_1688129359.pdf,July 2023,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/702/articles/225-240/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/supplementary-electronic-material-final_1688129359.pdf

Our objective was to learn more about the use of the small islands located close to the mainland coast as stopover areas by small migratory birds that cross the Bay of Biscay. Using data collected in a constant-effort mist-netting programme conducted on Izaro Island (northern Spain) during autumn migration (years 2018 to 2021), we aimed to determine (1) which species land on the island and for how long they stay there, and (2) their fuel load and fuel deposition rate. Structurally, the assemblage was dominated by Willow Warblers Phylloscopus trochilus, which on average accounted for 84% of the abundance. Clustering analyses reveal that the assemblage was rather homogeneous across the four study years. Most birds probably stayed on the island for less than 24 hours, with fewer than 5% being recaptured one or more days after their first capture. The first-capture-event body mass of Willow Warblers captured only once (8.0g, 95%CI 7.8-8.4g) did not differ from the initial body mass of those captured two or more times within a season (8.0g, 95% CI 7.0-9.0g), and those stopping over on Izaro had a negative mean fuel deposition rate of –0.2g/day (SE = 0.1g/d). Overall, Izaro was used as an emergency stopover site during the course of this study, where exhausted birds landed after sea-crossings. From a conservation standpoint, and as compared to other stopover sites used as ‘emergency’ stopover sites, results suggest that Izaro is of little value for replenishing the fuel stores of these small birds during autumn migration.",Basque coast; fuel; Izaro; ringing; stopover; Willow Warbler Phylloscopus trochilus.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp-6-arizaga-et-al-702_1687854348.pdf,July 2023,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/702/articles/241-255/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp-6-arizaga-et-al-702_1687854348.pdf

Such degradation may have an impact on the ability of automated signal recognition software, to detect and correctly identify bird vocalisations. BirdNET is a recently launched automated bird song recogniser commonly employed by researchers and the public. However, few studies have assessed its performance and our current knowledge about how BirdNET performance may vary over distance or with species is very limited. I aimed to evaluate whether BirdNET's ability to correctly identify bird vocalisations of three bird species varied over distance or according to recorder type and target species using a playback broadcast from 10 to 150m away. BirdNET's ability to correctly identify bird songs varied among species and generally decreased over distance but did not vary among recorder types. Overall BirdNET recall rate, defined as the percentage of vocalisations detected, and correctly identified, by the software, was 59.9% (499 vocalisations correctly identified of 840 vocalisations broadcast). A significantly higher number of vocalisations were correctly identified when broadcast at 50m or closer (mean recall rate of 92.2%), when compared to vocalisations broadcast farther than that distance (mean recall rate of 34.9%). Recall rate was also significantly higher for the Grasshopper Sparrow and the Hooded Warbler, when compared to the Gray Vireo. The number of misclassifications varied over distances and did not follow a linear pattern.

Males of the three bustards were significantly larger than females in all linear measurements and weight. These between-species/subspecies differences are consistent with a slight trend to insular dwarfism that probably selects for smaller size in the Canarian subspecies. Males are larger and heavier than females in the three bustards, as expected in polygynous species, suggesting a moderate effect of sexual selection acting on male size.

KARYAKIN; José Rafael GARRIDO LÓPEZ; Elvira G. NIKOLENKO,,"Electrocutions involving power lines negatively impact avian populations on six continents. Affected species and mitigation strategies to minimise these effects are well described in parts of North America, Europe and southern Africa and are being developed in Asia, Australia and South America. Probably the most geographically dispersed electric system in the world is in Russia, where avian electrocutions have been documented since the 1970s. Research into avian electrocutions in Kazakhstan and southern Russia is extensive but is largely unknown outside Russia, which limits opportunities to consider cumulative regional effects. This review summarises what is known of avian electrocutions in Kazakhstan and Russia. Avian electrocutions on power lines were first identified in Russia in 1937, with concerns focused on impacts on electric system reliability, not wildlife populations. Electrocutions increased substantially in the 1970s when construction standards transitioned from wooden poles with wooden crossarms, which posed relatively low risk, to concrete pylons with steel crossarms, which posed and continue to pose much higher risks. Impacts to raptor populations are greatest where 6-10kV electric systems traverse vast arid landscapes with few natural tall perches. Birds perching on pylons can simultaneously contact live (energised) conductors and earthed (grounded) crossarms, creating an electrical circuit. Raptors are the bird group most often electrocuted, and this source of non-natural mortality is contributing to declines in Asian raptor populations. For example, Steppe Eagle Aquila nipalensis populations have collapsed in the Caspian steppes of Kazakhstan and southern Russia, declining from 20,000 pairs to 1,100 pairs. Fines for electrocutions codified in Russian law are intended to persuade Russian electric utilities to implement mitigation measures, but because fines are rarely enforced either within Russia or within neighbouring countries, mitigation measures are largely omitted even in new construction, and even in places with extensive documentation of electrocutions. Importantly, electric systems are similar across the many countries of the former Soviet Union that now share international boundaries and connected electric systems, probably posing substantial cumulative risks for migrant birds traversing the region.",Aquila nipalensis; corvid; electrocution; falcon; kestrel; mitigation; retrofitting,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/review-1-jf-dwyer-et-al-701-comprimido_1669886830.pdf,January 2023,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/701/articles/3-27/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/supplementary-electronic-material-rewier-final_1669886856.pdf

However, molecular techniques revealed numerous cases of extra-pair fertilisations (epFs) in most bird species as well as multiple partners during breeding season. In this study, we examined the population of the Common Kingfisher Alcedo atthis breeding along the Danube River system in Slovakia during three consecutive breeding seasons (2016-2018). We analysed 618 individuals – 70 adults and 548 nestlings from 87 broods. Overall, six nestlings (1.09%) from three different broods (3.45%) were fathered by other than the pair male. None of the nestlings had a mother other than the pair female. Besides that, we detected two simultaneously polygamous males (5.13%). In seven cases (9.72%) we revealed mate change between different broods: female change in three cases (4.17%) and male change in four cases (5.55%). The occurrence of extra-pair nestlings as well as polygamy was not associated with the synchronicity of breeding attempts at the beginning of the season, while the type of mating strategy seems to be associated with nest density. at the same time, male body condition was unrelated to the type of mating strategy in which he was engaged. Conversely, polygamous males had higher genetic diversity (observed heterozygosity) than monogamous ones. No difference in genetic diversity was found between monogamous and polygamous females. There was no difference in breeding success before and after the change of partner. In addition, polygamous individuals did not have more young than monogamous birds, suggesting that having more than one partner does not ensure greater breeding productivity.

However, there are still important gaps in knowledge of its biology. Recent studies have highlighted the absence of information about survival, dispersal and migratory routes of juveniles, and the main aim of this study was to contribute to filling this gap. We used radio-transmitters and satellite tags (pTTs) to study the initial movements of juvenile Great Spotted Cuckoos in the study area (i. e. breeding territories), as well as their long-distance migratory movements. We found that a large proportion of marked individuals died in the study area within days or weeks of leaving the nest, with direct and indirect evidence suggesting that predation is the main cause of mortality. Our results suggest that pre-migratory movements of juveniles, i. e., those carried out before leaving the Iberian peninsula, are different from those previously found for experienced adults. The high predation rate in the study area meant that only three of 13 satellite-tagged juveniles initiated migration to their wintering area in sub-Saharan Africa, using the Eastern Atlantic route. Overall, the information provided here contributes to a better understanding of the biology of juvenile great Spotted Cuckoos and could be useful in addressing potential future conservation problems.",Africa; avian brood parasites; Iberia; predation; satellite tag; wintering area,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp3-supplementary-material-701_1675072133.pdf,January 2023,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/701/articles/59-74/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp3-supplementary-material-701_1675072133.pdf

The extension of urban areas and landscape configurations affects the ability of raptors to exploit urban patches. The Tawny Owl Strix aluco is a forest-dwelling nocturnal species with a wide distribution range that is well-adapted to urban environments. However, it remains unknown which habitat factors explain its presence in urban-associated landscapes. Our main objective is to determine the effect of urban landscapes on the probability of occurrence of Tawny Owls along an urban-rural gradient. It is expected that Tawny Owls will be able to use urban patches that have (1) at least 30% tree cover thanks to gardens/parks for hunting but (2) they will not use those with high noise levels (i. e., highways). Our research was carried out in the municipality of Donostia-San Sebastian in the Basque Country, Northern Spain. Data were obtained from a survey conducted in 2017. The municipality was divided into 329 square cells, of which 251 were surveyed. Tawny Owls were detected in 141 cells, and we found that nocturnal noise level and scrub cover contributed most to explaining the probability of Tawny Owl occurrence; with nocturnal noise having a significant negative effect on occurrence probability, and scrub cover a positive effect, probably because the species uses open or semi-open areas to hunt (but woodland to breed). Overall, it can be concluded that the very noisy and/or urbanized parts of the city comprised a non-optimal habitat for the species.",agglomeration noise; city ecology; GAM; presence-absence; San Sebastian; Strix aluco; Tawny Owl; urban environments,,,January 2023,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/701/articles/75-88/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VALLE; Francesco SCARTON,,"Coastal wetlands support many globally threatened seabird species and may be critical for their conservation. Sea level rise dramatically affects coastal tidal marshes, thus posing the greatest threat to the survival of many seabird species, including gulls and terns. Sandwich terns Thalasseus sandvicensis are particularly vulnerable to this threat. although they breed in a wide range of habitats they chiefly nest close to water, just above the tideline. here, we describe the particular vulnerability of the entire Sandwich tern breeding population of the Venice Lagoon. three colonies were found early in the 2022 breeding season, two of them on artificial habitat: on a small dredge island (0.01ha; 0.70m above sea level) in the northern Lagoon and on an islet (0.01ha, elevation 0.5m a. s. l.) formed by bricks of a collapsed old building in the Southern Lagoon. the third colony was on a natural marsh island (1.50ha, 0.40m a. s. l.). these colonies hosted respectively 150, 369 and 1,100 pairs. In total, 1,111 out of 1,619 nests (68.6%) were flooded early in the season, with marked differences between sites; nest losses ranged from 86% on the brick island through 69% on the marsh island to 0% on the dredge island. the terns laid 1,043 replacement clutches, exclusively on the dredge island, joining the birds on this safe site. Overall, 795 chicks fledged (0.30 per breeding attempt) over the whole breeding season, with extreme differences between colony sites. Productivity ranged from zero fledglings per breeding attempt on the marsh island through 0.14 on the brick island to 0.75 on the dredge island. Artificial sites such as dredge islands may offer safe nesting sites and enable high productivity for Sandwich tern when compared to saltmarsh islets. given the probability of future sea level rises, a long-term management plan for these artificial sites is urgently needed.",breeding success; dredge islands; drones; saltmarshes; sea level rise; unmanned aerial vehicles,,,January 2023,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/701/articles/89-103/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we aimed at producing absolute population estimates of post-breeding Gannets and evaluating the importance of the study area within the species’ migration range. We performed six aerial surveys in September and/or October each year between 2010 and 2015, covering 74,840km2 in total. Using line transect methodology, 3,672 Gannet sightings were recorded along 10,496.3 nautical miles (nm). Immature individuals and adults comprised approximately 87% of all sightings. Using Distance sampling, overall abundance was estimated at 89,930 birds, ranging from 58,010 individuals in 2014 to 128,140 in 2015. The highest densities per sector areas were recorded in the North and Centre sectors whereas the lowest densities were registered in the Galicia sector, the Spanish region within the study area. Gannets were mostly present in shallow shelf waters of the continental shelf, particularly between 3 and 20 nautical miles offshore. Habitat suitability models for Gannets in the study area were tested using several eco-geographical variables and chlorophyll concentrations were found to contribute most to explaining annual Gannet occurrence probabilities. A global interannual spatial analysis demonstrated the core areas for conservation of the Northern Gannet in Western Iberian Waters. Moreover, our results demonstrate that Western Iberian waters are used by almost 10% of the global Northern Gannet population, corroborating the existence of seabird hotspots during the non-breeding period, along migration corridors and at their wintering grounds.",distance sampling; Maxent; Morus bassanus; Portugal; Spain,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/supplementary-electronic-material-appendix-1_1652856724.pdf,July 2022,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/692/articles/179-202/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/supplementary-electronic-material-appendix-1_1652856724.pdf

In European mountains in particular, openhabitat bird species are threatened by a decrease in agro-pastoral activities and by global warming. Snow avalanches act as a natural agent of disturbance that maintains open habitats and thus may contribute to habitat heterogeneity at elevations below the treeline. Using the Rock Bunting Emberiza cia as a study species, we assessed the suitability of avalanche tracks as refuges for ecotone and semi-open habitat bird species. We studied habitat associations and other environmental factors that affect the species’ occurrence based on data from point counts and habitat surveys carried out in the Alps. Rock Bunting presence was greater on avalanche tracks than in adjacent habitats at lower elevations. habitats with high Rock Bunting presence were characterised by a shrubby mosaic that was more open than the surrounding forest. There was no difference between avalanche tracks and control points at the treeline. Rock Bunting densities at avalanche tracks in the forest were similar to those in the treeline and the alpine belt, thus showing that avalanches create an ecotone habitat equivalent to the treeline at lower elevations. Rock Buntings used grassy habitats that had an intermediate rock cover, with patches of shrubs inside gullies. This optimal habitat probably provides nest sites that minimise exposure to predators whilst being close to patches of grass that provide foraging habitat. In a context of climate change, where avalanche activity might increase due to later snowfalls in spring, habitat mosaics created by this type of disturbance could play a fundamental role in the conservation of semi-open habitat bird species in the Alps.",climate change; conservation; habitat associations; mountain ecosystems; treeline ecotone,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp-2-supplementary-electronic-material-appendix-1_1657018534.pdf,July 2022,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/692/articles/203-217/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp-2-supplementary-electronic-material-appendix-1_1657018534.pdf

In this study we examined whether the body condition of Greater Flamingos Phoenicopterus roseus was related to plumage coloration and the interaction of both variables with sex and foraging site. To this end, we conducted a field study to collect data on sex-related body condition and plumage coloration at two wetlands in southern Spain. We found that body condition was site-related, that the more colourful individuals were in better body condition, and that females were more colourful and in better body condition than males. Together, the results suggest that females have greater need than males to signal individual quality, likely because females encounter higher intraseasonal costs than males during reproduction, and choosing low-quality females could severely limit breeding success. Also, plumage coloration may signal individual status at foraging sites throughout the year.",abdominal profile; cosmetic coloration; individual quality; sexual differences; signals,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp-3-supplementary-electronic-material-appendix_1657020989.pdf,July 2022,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/692/articles/219-229/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp-3-supplementary-electronic-material-appendix_1657020989.pdf

Drones are increasingly used for ecological applications and their use seems to at least partially overcome these problems. The present study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of drone-conducted monitoring of productivity in Purple Herons Ardea purpurea breeding in NE Italy wetlands. The accuracy of drone counts using two drone approaches (overflight vs close-up) was compared using their combination as assumed true counts. The 14 colonies studied hosted 615 nests, the majority of which were located in reedbeds. Colony size did not differ in relation to habitat type. Colonies showed significant differences in productivity between habitats, with more young fledged in reedbed-located colonies than in bushes. Overall the accuracy of both overflight and close-up drone counts remained high in serial revisits throughout the breeding period. Drone surveys caused a low degree of disturbance. No apparent negative effects of drone flights on nesting pairs, clutches or young were observed. The study shows that drone use allowed an effective measurement of Purple Heron productivity that was rapid and safe for the birds.",Ardeidae; breeding success; unmanned aerial vehicle.,,,July 2022,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/692/articles/231-248/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We quantitatively and qualitatively compared DNA extracts, amplifications of two mitochondrial genes (~430 bp and 1040 bp), and molecular sexing between saliva and blood samples. As expected, blood samples provided larger amounts of DNA of heavy molecular weight than buccal swabs. However, buccal swabs were as reliable as blood samples as a source of genetic material to sequence mtDNA. On the other hand, buccal swab samples might require an improved PCR protocol to sex all individuals successfully.

However, these methods typically require many fieldwork days to provide initial insight into which bird species disperse the seeds of a plant species or community of interest. Here, we highlight the advantages of DNA-barcoding analysis after rapid field sampling to uncover unknown seed dispersers. By rapid field sampling we refer to searching and sampling bird-dispersed seeds during a short period of time (just a few hours) in places where the probability of seed deposition is high. This ‘one-day’ sampling strategy relies on a major advantage of DNA barcoding: it allows identifying disperser species during a relatively long period after they defecate or regurgitate seeds, over a time frame of several weeks. We showcase this methodological approach with three emblematic and threatened plant species for which there is little or no information on avian seed dispersal, either from their entire range or in certain populations. The approach can be cost-effective and very valuable for pilot studies aimed at providing initial information on poorly known systems, or in locations where periodical fieldwork is not feasible owing to accessibility or logistic constraints.",DNA barcoding; Ephedra fragilis; frugivory; Juniperus cedrus; Juniperus macrocarpa; pilot sampling; Turdus torquatus,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/supplementary-electronic-material-appendix-2_1654159780.pdf,July 2022,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/692/articles/279-290/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/supplementary-electronic-material-appendix-2_1654159780.pdf

One way to test this change is to examine the causes of admission of wildlife to recovery centres. In this study we analyse c. 70,000 admissions of birds to the three rehabilitation centres of the regional government of Valencia (Eastern Spain) during 30 years (1991-2020). Using multiple hypotheses testing, specified by means of Poisson regressions and selected via AIC, we found that our more parsimonious models included only the interaction between causes of admission, habitat and source of origin with time (in five-year periods). Specifically, admissions resulting from non-natural causes decreased over time and those due to accidents with infrastructure or due to non human-related causes showed an increase. birds of prey were more commonly admitted due to deliberate persecution than the other bird groups studied (6.36% v. 1.23%), but the trend over time of raptor admissions due to illegal shooting was negative and strong, declining from 21.7% in 1991-1995 to 3.0% in 2016-2020. Collisions against infrastructures were the main cause of accidental admissions (59.5%), followed by electrocutions (14.8%) and road kills (9.6%). Admissions due to natural causes were mainly of orphaned young birds or undernourished individuals (85%). The number of orphaned bird admissions increased exponentially during the study period. Regarding habitat of origin, bird admissions from urban and rural areas showed a stronger increase over time compared to those from natural areas. Finally, admissions from official sources prevailed until 2011, but thereafter unofficial (i. e. individual people) sources became prevalent. In summary, bird admissions initially coming from non-urban areas and associated with official entities shifted to coming from urban areas associated with unofficial sources. This is interpreted by us to be a reliable confirmation of the change in attitudes of modern Spanish society towards wildlife. Causes of admission to wRCs are dynamic at decadal time scales and are expected to keep changing in the near future.",bird conservation; human attitude; rehabilitation centre; societal shifts,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/supplementary-electronic-material-appendix-1-sc1_1657886108.pdf,July 2022,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/692/articles/291-302/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/supplementary-electronic-material-appendix-1-sc1_1657886108.pdf

We used Generalized Additive Models (GzAM) to estimate the number of birds that could have entered or left the Mediterranean Sea on the days that no counting took place. Auks entered the Mediterranean from early October to early winter, peaking in the second half of November. In spring, Razorbill movements leaving the Mediterranean were concentrated from mid-January to mid-April, while the peak Atlantic Puffin movement occurred from mid-February to May. We estimate that 4,000-5,000 Razorbills and 15,000 Atlantic Puffins made up the populations migrating through the Strait of Gibraltar in the year of the study. These figures are notably lower than those previously reported for auks passing through this migratory bottleneck.

SEGURA,,"Philornis flies exert strong negative selection on avian host life histories. However, their possible influence at the southern limits of parasite distribution remains poorly studied. We collected data on Philornis parasitism (prevalence, parasite load and latency) during three consecutive breeding seasons of the Masked Gnatcatcher Polioptila dumicola, Vermilion Flycatcher Pyrocephalus rubinus and Blue-and-yellow Tanager Pipraeidea bonariensis in a south temperate forest in Argentina. We hypothesised that Philornis parasitism would negatively influence both the growth and survival of infected nestlings. Regarding body size differences among nestlings of these three host species, we predicted that nestling survival in parasitised nests and parasite load per nestling would be greater the larger the species, and that the number of growth parameters that differ between parasitised and non-parasitised nestlings would be greater the smaller the species. We monitored 564 nests and found prevalence to be 16.7% for the Masked Gnatcatcher, 30.1% for the Vermilion Flycatcher, and 37.9% for the Blue-and-yellow Tanager. Parasitism increased during the season for all three species. As predicted, for the three species, nestling survival was lower in parasitised nests (~30%) than in nonparasitised nests (~90%) and for each species, one or more growth parameters were significantly lower for parasitised nestlings compared to non-parasitised nestlings. Our prediction relating to host body size was partially supported since differences in parasite load only emerged in nests that produced fledglings, as well as in the extent of growth parameters affected.

Whilst studies on mountain biodiversity at the species level are common, studies that consider whole assemblages are scarce. We assessed how an alpine bird assemblage varied in terms of ecological habitat niche by surveying birds and habitat at point count sites placed along elevational gradients (1,700-3,000m) in the Western Italian Alps. Niche breadth, as measured by habitat use, increased along the gradient, suggesting that being more generalist is an advantage in terms of survival at high elevation. Niche position also increased with elevation, which means that species occurring at higher elevations use habitats that are atypical with respect to the average species in the assemblage. Both niche breadth and position were negatively associated with habitat diversity, but these relationships were mainly driven by species occurring at elevations above 2,500m, suggesting that high alpine specialists show a different pattern from the other species of the assemblage. Our results therefore generally supported the idea that a wider niche breadth is useful in harsh environments, such as high mountains, enabling the exploitation of a wider range of resources. The broader niche of many high elevation species may therefore indicate some degree of resilience to environmental change, as long as key habitat types are maintained.",Alpine specialists; avian community; mountains; habitat niche,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/supplementary-electronic-material-appendix-1_1635495046.pdf,January 2022,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/691/articles/41-58/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/supplementary-electronic-material-appendix-1_1635495046.pdf

Its future greatly depends on the quality of its remaining habitat, particularly in mountains where no previous study has explored the effects of climate and snow condition on its populations. In the Gavarnie Special Protection Area (9,300ha, Pyrenees National Park), a highly mountainous open landscape mainly covered by grassland, alpine moorland, screes and rocks, we compared the reproductive success of Red-billed Choughs during two very contrasted years, 2013 and 2014, in terms of snow phenology in spring. We also evaluated foraging habitat selection during the young rearing period. Habitat selection was estimated by modelling the probability, for 50 Å~ 50m<sup>2</sup> spatial units sampled in the study area, of being observed to be used by choughs for foraging. Breeding success was much lower during the year with prolonged spring snow cover, especially at higher elevation: 11 breeding pairs were present, compared to 22 pairs during the following year when snow cover phenology was more typical. Nesting phenology was delayed by ten days in the year with prolonged snow cover. Variables that positively influenced the probability for choughs to use spatial units as feeding areas were mostly linked with the presence of low vegetation (herbaceous or mixed scrub and grassland areas, grazed areas), and the absence of snow (time of snow cover during study period, exposure to solar radiation, presence of wetlands). we suggest that snow cover at the end of the cold season can create a spatial mismatch between customary chough nest locations at high elevations and areas suitable for foraging. The consequence is a scarcity of nesting attempts and low breeding success in the mountainous areas during years with prolonged and high altitude snow cover in spring. we also use these results to suggest the potential for this species to be used as an indicator for the effects of changes in climate and pasture grazing practices.",Bird Special Protected Area; mountain; Natura 2000; Pyrenees National Park; Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax; weather,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp-4-supplementary-electronic-material-appendix-1_1637913303.pdf,January 2022,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/691/articles/59-74/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp-4-supplementary-electronic-material-appendix-1_1637913303.pdf

Considerable knowledge gaps exist regarding the habitat associations of the Sri Lanka Frogmouth, a nocturnal bird restricted to Sri Lanka and the Indian Western Ghats. Via a 20-year island-wide survey, we searched for frogmouths in Sri Lanka to determine their habitat associations at both local and landscape scales and developed a habitat suitability model (HSM) to predict both current and future distribution. We confirmed frogmouth presence in 18% of the surveyed sites across all major bioclimatic zones (wet, intermediate, dry, and arid) from lower elevations (11-767m), comprising a broad geographic range. Frogmouth presence was mostly limited to forests (90%) with a few sites in agricultural mosaics. Land protection, altitude and both local and landscape-scale forest cover, as well as forest-cover loss at both spatial scales, were strong predictors of frogmouth presence. According to our HSM, the southwestern lowlands and parts of the intermediate zone contained the most suitable areas for frogmouths despite their smaller extent. Although the dry and intermediate zones contained extensive habitats for frogmouth, these regions were relatively less suitable. The habitat associations and geographic range of this species in Sri Lanka differ from that seen in India through negative associations with altitude and absence from montane zones, absence from degraded or severely disturbed habitats and independence from proximity to waterways. The Sri Lanka Frogmouth is sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances, including historical forest losses. We recommend landscape-scale conservation planning that incorporates both primary and mature persistent secondary forests to ensure the protection of this unique iconic species.",autecology; conservation; habitat suitability modeling; nocturnal birds; podargidae,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp-5-supplementary-electronic-material-appendix-1_1637914784.pdf,January 2022,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/691/articles/75-95/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp-5-supplementary-electronic-material-appendix-1_1637914784.pdf

Our results show that, in general, occurrences in citizen science databases are better explained by the studied variables than professional databases, but no clear differences were found when analysed individually. Both citizen science and professional databases contain invaluable information on biodiversity but every database comes with a particular history and its stored data is the result of years of field sampling with heterogeneous goals, sampling methods and sampling effort.

To address this gap, during 2017-2019, we conducted a study on its breeding performance on Tenerife, the largest and the most densely populated island of the Canarian archipelago. we constructed generalized linear mixed models to evaluate the potential effects of nest features on breeding performance. Two variables explained breeding success: the distance from the nest to the nearest paved road, and the presence of pebbles at the entrance of the nest-burrow, which correlated negatively and positively with breeding success, respectively. The majority of failures occurred during the incubation period. Breeding failures were mainly related to egg abandonment and rat predation upon eggs or chicks.

However, there is only anecdotal information on their opposite role as perpetrators of nest takeovers and occasional killings of other songbirds. Over 31 years we examined whether competition with Great Tits Parus major over nest box ownership is a significant source of mortality for Pied Flycatchers and whether the increase in Pied Flycatcher populations affected the use of nest boxes by the smallest tit species, the Blue Tit Cyanistes caeruleus and Coal Tit Periparus ater, in two forests in the central Iberian Mountain Range. We found 31 Pied Flycatchers killed inside nest boxes. The Great Tit was the most frequent species to which the killings were attributed. Followed by Pied Flycatchers themselves and Nuthatches Sitta europaea. We confirmed the killing by Pied Flycatchers of at least two conspecific males and one incubating female Coal Tit, with one killer male identified. Large increases in population densities of flycatchers after nest box deployment in the two study areas seem to have triggered an intensification of agonistic interactions among their potential occupants, resulting in an increase of takeovers by Pied Flycatchers of nest boxes initially owned by the smallest tit species. Great Tits are not a serious threat for Pied Flycatchers breeding in the study area, most likely due to their preference for natural holes over the nest box types most frequently installed. The interactions of Pied Flycatchers with Blue and Coal Tits for the ownership of nest boxes do not seem to cause significant mortality in the species involved. However, aggressive usurpations of nest boxes by Pied Flycatchers surely have negative impacts on the reproductive success of the victims through their eviction from suitable nesting sites.",competition; contests; hole-nesting; killings; long-term studies; nest usurpations; Paridae,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/appendix-1-supplementary-electronic-material_1611571888.pdf,July 2021,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/682/articles/315-333/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/appendix-1-supplementary-electronic-material_1611571888.pdf

Natural changes tend to increase diversity and abundance, whereas anthropic changes often have the opposite effect. We analyse how landscaping for the creation of research facilities influenced the taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity of bird communities in a Caribbean coastal rainforest of Costa Rica, and whether diversity changes were mediated by changes in vegetation structure. Bird communities were sampled by means of mist nets located in the landscaped areas and in paired sites of the nearby rainforest during three consecutive dry seasons (2017-2019). Vegetation structure around each net was also recorded. Forest openness and degree of development of the tree layer led to more abundant and species-rich assemblages in both the managed and the non-managed sites. Functional diversity of several key traits (diet, beak shape, manoeuvrability and foraging site) was favoured by the degree of development of the tree layer in managed sites and by those of the shrub layer in the forest. Beta diversity analyses showed that increased diversity in managed areas was due to a higher presence of species linked to naturally cleared forest areas already present in the forest, rather than to a substitution of a species-poor forest assemblage by a species-rich open-land community. Overall, we show that low-intensity disturbance linked to the creation and maintenance of research facilities can favour the conservation of richer and functionally diverse bird communities, at least in species-rich secondary rainforests, as long as a well-developed tree layer is maintained in the cleared areas.",beta-diversity analyses; Caribbean rainforest; management; mist-nets; vegetation structure,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/appendix-1-supplementary-electronic-material-2_1612426065.pdf,July 2021,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/682/articles/355-371/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/appendix-1-supplementary-electronic-material-2_1612426065.pdf

Simultaneous observations occurred at four watchpoints, three on the Sicilian side and one on the continental boundary (Calabrian side). Although northwesterly winds prevailed at the Strait during peak migration days, slightly different local patterns of both horizontal and vertical winds at each observation site affected flocking and shaped the passage of raptors through this bottleneck, broadening the migration front. The results confirm that the magnitude of Honey-buzzard spring migration at the Strait is strongly affected by wind patterns in the Sicilian Channel.

ESTADES,,"Habitat specialists, such as forest raptors, are generally more likely to suffer from the impacts of large-scale forestry. One of the most characteristic and controversial aspects of many industrial plantation systems is the use of clearcutting as a harvesting method, which generates a mosaic of highly contrasting land cover types, such as wooded areas adjacent to zones practically devoid of vegetation. We explored the effect of forest cover on the abundance of habitat-generalist and forestspecialist raptors in South-central Chile. During the 2016 to 2018 breeding seasons, we conducted 584 playback surveys at 149 sampling points centred on 3x3km plots within 9x9km squares. The Rufous-legged Owl Strix rufipes, a forest specialist, showed a positive relationship with forest cover at the local scale. However, we found no significant relationships for other forest specialists in this study. Most habitat-generalist species showed a negative or non-linear relationship with forest cover, with greater species abundances observed in landscapes with intermediate levels of forest and open areas. Interestingly, the models with the highest statistical support included total forest cover (native forest + plantations) as a predictor, suggesting that the habitat-generalist species did not significantly discriminate between natural and artificial forests. Our results show that both generalist and forest-specialist raptors can use landscapes dominated by exotic plantations in South-central Chile.",clearcutting; commercial forestry; monterey pine; owls; Pinus radiata; raptor conservation,,,July 2021,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/682/articles/391-408/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we used Mediterranean Great Tits Parus major to test the hypothesis that parents show a consistent level of individual specialisation across years. To do this, we recorded prey delivered to 10-14 day-old chicks over six years. We standardised the data to control for environmental factors and used a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to characterise the foraging provisioning behaviour of individuals. We assessed long-term dietary consistency using data from individuals recorded in two different years by performing a repeatability analysis (absolute consistency) and also running a Generalised Linear Mixed Model, where we measured the consistency of position of individuals in a group, relative to others (relative consistency). The PCA analysis showed that diet selection when provisioning chicks varies across two gradients: prey size vs. frequency of prey delivery, and caterpillars vs. spiders. Controlling for these factors, we found that both individual repeatability and the correlation of diet choices between years were moderately significant. Although Great Tits show high individual dietary specialisation within a year, diet fluctuates to some extent across years. This could provide a degree of flexibility to parents dealing with highly fluctuating environmental conditions as well as a buffer against climate change, and could be a consequence of increasing lifetime experience.",diet; diet consistency; individual specialisation; parental provisioning,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/supplementary-electronic-material-art-6_1624876647.pdf,July 2021,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/682/articles/409-422/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/supplementary-electronic-material-art-6_1624876647.pdf

Scientific evidence shows that Spain should (1) identify clear regional biodiversity targets and the landscape-level measures needed to achieve them; (2) define ambitious and complementary criteria across the three environmental instruments (enhanced conditionality, eco-schemes, and agri-environmental and climate measures) of the CAP’s Green Architecture, especially in simple and complex landscapes; (3) ensure that other CAP instruments (areas of nature constraints, organic farming and protection of endangered livestock breeds and crop varieties) really support biodiversity; (4) improve farmers’ knowledge and adjust measures to real world constraints; and (5) invest in biodiversity and ecosystem service monitoring in order to evaluate how the Plan achieves regional and national targets and to improve measures if targets are not met. We conclude that direct assessments of environmental objectives are technically and economically feasible, can be attractive to farmers, and are socially fair and of great interest for improving the environmental effectiveness of CAP measures.

For some species, such as small pelagic seabirds, foraging grounds are difficult to locate and remain largely unknown. We used miniaturised GPS devices (~0.95g) to study foraging movements of Mediterranean Storm-petrels Hydrobates pelagicus melitensis during the incubation period. A total of 43 individuals at Benidorm colony (southwestern Mediterranean Sea) were tracked during a single foraging trip. We first assessed potential negative effects of the tracking devices. We recorded 22 complete foraging trips and measured homerange, foraging areas and the degree of overlap among individuals. We used first passage time analyses (FPT) to differentiate foraging/resting from flying/travelling activities and to infer potential foraging areas. All tracked birds returned to the colony. On average, individual body weight slightly decreased after foraging trips, suggesting a small immediate negative effect of the device. Tracked birds had high breeding success (0.71). Foraging trips lasted between 1 and 4.5 days with the total distance travelled ranging between 303.14 and 1,726.53km. The visited areas covered the whole south-western part of the Mediterranean Sea. Tracked individuals shared more than 50% of their home-range areas. Foraging areas were located further from the colony than previously thought (from 240 to 469km away) on deep sea areas of the Alboran Sea and Cartagena Canyons.

Passeriformes) richness in the south-western Palearctic, a major wintering ground for the European avifauna. We apply three complementary approaches. First, we assess the way climate, landscape and habitat affect species richness by means of field counts across the study area. Second, we model the spatial distribution of six common passerines using ring recoveries as presence data. Finally, where the resulting models predict the actual distribution of birds, we employ the models to forecast the future distribution of richness according to predictions of climate change, i. e. of increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation. The results support an effect of landscape, habitat structure, temperature and precipitation on bird richness. Distribution models fit the actual distribution of bird richness and their predictions suggest that winter species richness will decrease in lowlands and increase in highlands. This pattern could be related to direct effects of temperature on thermoregulatory costs and indirect effects on winter primary productivity affecting food resources. These results also indicate that, in a context of climate warming, species-rich sectors will shift from lowlands to highlands, suggesting that uplands will have a regulatory role in the future winter distribution of birds.

Gordo (2018) has proposed that abundance data recorded by common bird monitoring schemes (e. g.

We carried out numerical simulations and analysed the interspecific pattern of statistical significance of the published population trends of the Spanish common birds census, the SACRE programme (1998-2011), in order to test how the number of repetitions of censuses per year affects the power of tests: (i. e. the probability of detecting significant trends that are in fact true), and the probability of obtaining low false discovery rates: i. e. identifying significant changes that are actually false, when estimating yearly population changes. we agree with Gordo (2018) that two surveys of the same sampling stations per year are unable to detect the maximum number of birds throughout a breeding season. Nevertheless, the goal of monitoring programmes is not to obtain the maximum number of birds at each sampling unit over a long time span but to measure reliable population trends. Our results demonstrate that the average number of birds recorded in two surveys per season provides a highly reliable indication of population trends for abundant and widely distributed bird species, the focal taxa in common birds monitoring schemes, especially of long-term average trends > ±2.5% change annually.

These factors may disrupt food webs, threatening the survival of organisms and, ultimately, ecosystem functioning. However, few studies focus on the trends of different groups joined by trophic links in alpine ecosystems. The Yellow-billed (Alpine) Chough, Pyrrhocorax graculus, a gregarious bird that moves in flocks, is an ideal target species within this framework since it has a grasshopper-based diet during the summer and may attend sites that are heavily developed for recreational activities. We tested therefore whether flock size co-varied with grasshopper abundance along an elevational gradient in two alpine areas subject to different levels of human disturbance. Chough flock size and grasshopper abundance were measured along elevational transects. The median flock size was analysed in relation to grasshopper abundance and biomass, we also conducted negative binomial gLMs to account for effects of period (i. e. from june to mid-August), site and elevation. In both study areas, chough flocks were larger at the elevation where grasshoppers were more abundant. This may indicate the capacity of the species to follow large-scale fluctuations in their key insect prey. On the other hand, the relationship between flock size and grasshopper biomass was positive at a natural site and negative at a tourist site. This suggests that where there is a high level of human influence, other factors, such as the availability of human provided food, may disturb the natural relationship between choughs and their key prey. Overall, our results indicate that flocking by foraging Yellow-billed Choughs reflects both grasshopper abundance and the degree of anthropogenic influence.",Alpine Chough; foraging; flock size; grasshoppers; human development,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp-4-appendix-1-supplementary-electronic-material_1597651351.pdf,January 2021,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/681/articles/53-70/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp-4-appendix-1-supplementary-electronic-material_1597651351.pdf

CARRASCAl; Virginia MORALEDA; José COlSA; Fernando GARCÉS; Claudia SCHUSTER,,"Carcass counts notably underestimate avian collision rates due to three main bias sources: imperfect detection, carcass removal by scavengers and carcass dispersion in unsearched areas. We assessed these sources of bias at electric lines of two Canary Islands, lanzarote and Fuerteventura, quantifying the factors influencing them. We also carried out a cost-effectiveness assessment of carcass search done perpendicularly to electric line axis. We surveyed 230km of three types of electric lines (high-voltage, medium voltage and telephone lines) during three periods (July 2015, November-December 2015 and March 2016) searching for collision fatalities (N = 431), recording the species, the carcass distance from the electric line, mean cable height, carcass detection distance and decomposition state. In addition, we carried out a disappearance rate experiment to estimate carcass removal by scavengers. A generalised least squares model was used to analyse dispersion distance of carcass from electric lines, in relation to species body mass, mean cable height and line typology. Detection probability functions were fitted to estimate carcass detectability, incorporating body mass, decomposition state and habitat structure as covariates. A Generalised Mixed-Effects model was carried out to analyse carcass disappearance in relation to time elapsed since carcass placement, carcass size, season and island. Dispersion distance decreased with body mass and increased with cable height, being further at high-voltage lines. Overall, detection probability was 0.134, increasing with carcass size, decreasing with decomposition state and being lower in rocky areas which offered a significant challenge when walking through rough terrain. Disappearance rates differed between islands probably due to differences in avian scavenger abundance, increased with time elapsed and decreased with bird size. This study provides correction factors to obtain unbiased estimates of avian mortality rates within sparsely vegetated landscapes. Moreover, it identifies a 27m threshold distance at which the cost-effectiveness of searching for carcasses is optimised.",avian carcasses; Canary Islands; collisions at electric lines; cost-effectiveness assessment; decomposition rates; detectability; disappearance rates,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/appendix-1-aandbsupplementary-electronic-material_1600239791.pdf,January 2021,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/681/articles/71-94/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/appendix-1-aandbsupplementary-electronic-material_1600239791.pdf

In addition to describing these behaviours, we used generalised linear mixed models to identify the factors that determine hatching probability, such as laying date, nesting habitat and incubation behaviour. We found a high capacity (53%) to produce replacement clutches following nest failure. Unsuccessful nests represented 67.9% of clutches, mainly due to the low hatching rate of replacement clutches (16.7%) but also of the first clutches (44%). The main causes of failure were nest abandonment or predation (58%), while farming practices were responsible for 38.9% of failures. We found an increased risk of failure due to desertion or predation towards the end of the incubation. The risk of failure was higher in late clutches, although this seemed to be directly related to cereal mowing and to changes in nesting substrate, from cereal to alfalfa, which occurred throughout the breeding season. Likewise, we found a negative effect of the size of the field where the nest was found and of the surrounding habitat on the hatching probability, which we related to the availability of food for the female in these fields. Measures aimed at improving food provision, by increasing field edge density and fallow availability, would help to maintain hens in good condition prior to and during incubation, as well as providing suitable habitat for replacement clutches. Adaptive irrigation and mowing patterns in alfalfa fields during the nesting season could contribute to increasing the hatching success of replacement clutches.",agricultural practices; farmland birds; gyneparental incubation; nest attendance; nest survival; replacement clutches,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/appendix-1-supplementary-electronic-material_1601378270.pdf,January 2021,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/681/articles/95-122/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/appendix-1-supplementary-electronic-material_1601378270.pdf

Dispersal allows genetic connectivity and demographic compensation between neighbouring populations. These issues are particularly significant for species confined to mountaintops, as is the Rock Ptarmigan Lagopus muta in southern Europe. We studied natal dispersal and survival in juvenile Rock Ptarmigan in the French Alps and Pyrenees between 1999 and 2018 by radiotracking 113 young captured in September in two study areas. At both sites natal dispersal occurred in two discrete phases, in autumn (October-November) and in spring (late March-mid-May). Juvenile females dispersed twice as far as males in autumn at both sites but this difference decreased in spring and was not significant. Juveniles of both sexes dispersed further in the Pyrenees than in the Alps (males: 3.5 vs. 1.4km; females: 6.5 vs. 4.4km), a situation we attribute more to genetic differences between the two populations rather than to environmental factors. As to geographical barriers to dispersal, our radiotracking data along with extensive visual observations suggest that Rock Ptarmigan living in the Alps and the Pyrenees rarely fly across valleys 10-12km wide. For sexes and locations combined, the survival rate of juvenile Rock Ptarmigan during a ten-month period (September to June) was 0.636 (95%CI: 0.551-0.734). Long-distance dispersal tended to reduce the survival of birds during their first breeding attempt (April-June), a result that suggests a delayed effect of such dispersal.",alpine habitat; dispersal barrier; France; grouse; population connectivity; seasonal movement; Spain,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/appendix-1-supplementary-electronic-material_1601380611.pdf,January 2021,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/681/articles/123-141/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/appendix-1-supplementary-electronic-material_1601380611.pdf

Species communicating in low-frequency ranges (having large sound production structures) and with limited vocal learning are expected to be especially vulnerable to human noise-induced masking interference. Yet how such species may confront this emerging impact has scarcely been explored. Here we examined the effect of anthropogenic noise on the calling behaviour of a sizeable non-passerine bird, the Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax, across a gradient of road traffic noise and in relation to male position within the lek. Using directional recordings and noise mapping, We determined inter– and intra-individual variation in call parameters and their relationship with noise level and frequency at both spatial and temporal scales, defined respectively as (i) variation of noise according to the position of the calling sites of each male within the lek (spatial scale) and (ii) fine temporal variation of noise experienced by individual males immediately prior to each call (temporal scale). Little Bustard males increased their call rate at sites exposed to higher average noise levels and at those located further from the nearest neighbour within the lek, whereas temporal changes in noise showed no effect on call rate. In contrast, call duration decreased with relative increases in noise level prior to each call, being unaffected by spatial changes in noise. Peak call frequency showed no significant variation over time and among sites. Our findings reveal that, despite its supposedly limited vocal learning, this species seems to exhibit fine-scale vocal adjustment, which implies some capacity to cope with anthropogenic noise. However, the lack of frequency shift suggests behavioural constraints that may compromise communication as the species uses low-pitched calls. This study provides insights into how some non-passerine birds may adjust their vocal sexual display to anthropogenic noise.",Lekking behaviour; road traffic; sound masking; steppe birds; vocal adjustment,,,January 2021,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/681/articles/143-162/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we explored the relationships between haemosporidian infection status, body condition and nestling feeding rate in helpers, female breeders and male breeders of a cooperative breeding corvid, the Iberian (Azure-winged) Magpie Cyanopica cooki. For infection status we differentiated between uninfected birds and, separately, those infected with one or more than one Leucocytozoon parasitic lineage. Our predictions were that both breeder and helper Iberian Magpies harbouring a haemosporidian mixed infection should show lower body condition and nestling feeding rates than single-infected and uninfected birds. We found that most of the Iberian Magpies studied (78.7%) were infected with Leucocytozoon species, most of them (67.1% of Leucocytozoon-infected individuals) harbouring mixed infections. The scaled body mass index did not differ with respect to infection status in male or female breeders; however, mixed-infected helpers showed lower body condition than single-infected ones. Moreover, we found that mixed-infected males, as well as single and mixed-infected female breeders, but not infected helpers, showed lower nestling feeding rates than uninfected individuals. These findings could indicate a compromise between reproductive and immune functions in the Iberian Magpie, which effect becomes more evident in those individuals with a higher reproductive investment during the breeding period.",helpers; immune system; Leucocytozoon; parasites; reproduction,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/appendix-1-supplementary-electronic-material_1601994915.pdf,January 2021,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/681/articles/163-180/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/appendix-1-supplementary-electronic-material_1601994915.pdf

The results of our non-invasive study revealed a balanced ASR in spring, whereas hunted specimens had a strongly male-biased ratio for adults but an approximately balanced sex ratio for juveniles (",adult sex ratio; Alps; Lagopus muta; male vigilance; non-invasive sampling; Pyrenees,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/appendix-1-supplementary-electronic-material_1601541946.pdf,January 2021,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/681/articles/193-204/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/appendix-1-supplementary-electronic-material_1601541946.pdf

Avian malaria parasites and related haemosporidians are vectorborne parasites infecting birds worldwide. Recent studies have reported a greater attraction of mosquitoes to infected birds, supporting the host manipulation hypothesis. Changes in the composition of the uropygial gland secretion of birds associated with infections have been proposed as the potential mechanisms explaining this pattern. Here we critically review the published information on the host manipulation hypothesis in the context of avian malaria infections. We focus this article on the suggested role of the secretions of the uropygial gland and bird odours as mosquito attractants. The role of uropygial gland secretions as attractants of mosquitoes was poorly supported by available literature. In contrast, changes in the odour profile of infected birds or a reduction in the anti-mosquito behaviour of infected individuals may explain the parasite-mediated effects on mosquito attraction and biting rates. Finally, we propose future research approaches to identify the role of parasite infections on the interaction between birds and insect vectors.",Culicoides; Haemoproteus; Leucocytozoon; mosquitos; parasitos; Plasmodium,,,January 2021,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/681/articles/205-218/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although we understand the effects of forest fragmentation on species richness and distribution, we still need to uncover the physiological mechanisms underlying the success of organisms living in disturbed habitats. In this study, we used feather corticosterone levels as a measurement of physiological indicators of stress, evaluating whether corticosterone levels mirror the effects of habitat fragmentation on species occurrence. Since data suggest that smaller islands can reduce habitat suitability, increasing stress in birds that live within them, we predicted that birds living in smaller islands would present increased feather corticosterone levels. We captured birds in 13 islands of varying size and in two continuous forests and analysed feather corticosterone levels of 265 individuals from eight different species. Overall, our findings did not support the hypothesis that corticosterone varies in relation to island size, except for the Guianan Antwarbler Hypocnemis cantator, which presented the predicted pattern: decreasing feather corticosterone levels with increasing island size. These differences suggest that species respond differently to stressors driven by fragmentation. Further studies are necessary to assess the reliability of corticosterone levels as a physiological measurement of stress and to determine which parameters are useful to understand how insularisation caused by human activities may influence the resistance of avian populations to habitat disturbances.",Amazon hydropower; corticosterone; glucocorticoid; habitat loss; islands; physiological stress,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp-1-bicudo-supplementary-electronic-material_1582555621.pdf,July 2020,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/672/articles/229-245/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp-1-bicudo-supplementary-electronic-material_1582555621.pdf

At the same time, the steepest population declines of Red Kite have been recorded there, electrocution by power lines being one of the main causes. Thus, knowledge about the annual spatio-temporal ecology of this raptor, and its relationship to electrocution events, is necessary to develop effective conservation measures. Distribution models for the breeding and wintering populations of the Red Kite in Castilla y león were developed, considering climate, topography and land uses, to analyse the potential spatial variation between them. Models for electrocution risk also considered the technical characteristics of the power poles to determine their impact on electrocution events in both seasons. Our results show two different areas are used seasonally: 1) an important wintering area in the centre of the region, characterised by crop zones, moderate temperatures, rubbish dump sites and human presence, and 2) a nesting area in the south of the region, in which the availability of livestock carcasses, low levels of precipitation, distance from landfills and gentle relief were the most influential variables. the electrocution risk model indicates that the most suitable areas for Red Kite reproduction are also those that are most risky, including power poles of the most dangerous types; those with straight or vaulted cross-arms.

I used survey data from the central part of the Gulf of Gabès, Tunisia, to assess the significance of ecological and anthropogenic factors as predictors of the density of wintering oystercatchers. Using generalized linear mixed models, Oystercatcher density was positively correlated with sediment mud content and negatively correlated with seagrass cover. Density was also positively correlated with distance from human settlements and negatively correlated with the densities of recreationists and artisanal fishermen. Overall, oystercatchers avoid intertidal areas near human settlements. This study provides critical information on where conservation and research efforts should be focused to preserve this wader species.

We found a significant population decline (around 58%) in the number of birds counted in leks. Most capercaillies inhabit coniferous forests of Black Pine with abundant Bilberry and rhododendron understorey. The number of males declined at lower altitudes and in more exposed orientations, in a scenario consistent with the differential rate of loss of habitat quality due to climate change. We hypothesised that one of the main causes of the Capercaillie decline could be low breeding success (average annual productivity 0.67 chicks per female). In light of the decline rates observed, the Pyrenean population should be relisted as endangered in the Spanish National Catalogue of Endangered Species.

ASTUDILLO; Ingo GRASS; David C. SIDDONS; Dana G. SCHABO; Nina FARWIG,,"Habitat loss and landscape fragmentation are important drivers of changes in biodiversity. In fragmented landscapes, bird species are able to use multiple forest patches that may therefore share an important portion of the regional biodiversity. In turn, these patches are linked through their shared bird diversity (i. e. species-habitat networks). Identifying the importance of nodes (e. g. forest patches) in species-habitat networks is increasingly important to improve conservation planning. Within this network approach, the relative importance of patches for birds can be identified via centrality indices-measures of the magnitude of shared bird diversity of patches across the entire network (i. e. patch centrality). Here, we tested for changes in patch centrality within bird species-patch networks of two habitat guilds, forest specialists and generalists, in relation to patch area, patch shape irregularity and within-patch habitat characteristics across 15 Polylepis woodland patches in a páramo landscape of southern Ecuador. Patch centrality for forest specialists decreased with greater influence of surrounding páramo plants, i. e. an increasing proportion of bunch-grasses and small shrubs, in the within-patch habitat and was unaffected by either patch area or patch shape irregularity. On the other hand, patch centrality for generalists was positively influenced by patch shape irregularity but was unaffected by patch area or the influence of surrounding páramo plants in the within-patch habitat. Patch centrality reveals that the relative importance of Polylepis woodlands lies in their habitat quality. Forest specialists are dependent on mature Polylepis woodland patches, while generalists benefit from the natural irregular shape of the woodlands. Finally, a species-habitat network approach facilitates the recognition of important Polylepis patches and their characteristics for conservation of the Andean bird community at a landscape scale.",Ecuador; forest specialists; habitat guilds; páramo landscape; tropical Andes,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp-5-supplementary-material-astudillo-et-al-ardeola672_1588243709.pdf,July 2020,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/672/articles/307-324/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp-5-supplementary-material-astudillo-et-al-ardeola672_1588243709.pdf

These pigments are important for many physiological functions and individuals could find a trade-off between the allocation of carotenoids for these uses and their accumulation for secondary-sexual and social traits. The Yellow-legged Gull Larus michahellis is an opportunistic species that feeds on a wide spectrum of prey. We studied whether carotenoid-based colouration (bill, red spot, eye-ring) is related to the trophic ecology inferred by the isotopic composition of adults’ feathers at three colonies of this species. The isotopic marker δ13C negatively correlated with carotenoid-based colouration (red spot area). Contrarily to a priori prediction, the marker indicated that higher consumption of landfill scraps and terrestrial prey might lead to a larger red bill spot in adult Yellow-legged Gulls independently of sex. No correlation was detected between isotopic signatures and egg volume in females. the finding that higher consumption of marine prey may imply a smaller red spot supports some results from other avian studies that report that feeding on human-related terrestrial food sources has an apparently positive effect on the adult phenotype. The results may suggest that higher consumption of marine prey may not be as advantageous as supported by previous studies. Nonetheless, the effects of potentially toxic compounds that may come from some feeding sources should be further studied, including any delayed sub-lethal effects on the physiology of adults and, probably, chicks.",carotenoid-based colouration; individual quality; seabirds; stable isotopes; trophic ecology,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp-6-supplementary-material-zorrozua-et-al-ardeola672_1588580691.pdf,July 2020,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/672/articles/325-339/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp-6-supplementary-material-zorrozua-et-al-ardeola672_1588580691.pdf

Wing shape differences among species have been frequently studied but differences can also be found within species, between sexes and age groups. Many studies have assessed differences in wing shape between juveniles and adults in different passerine species but little is known about such differences in other bird orders. Performing a Size Constrained Components Analysis (SCCA) and a graphical approximation, we analysed the wing shape of juveniles and adults of eight species, including four passerines and four non-passerines of three different orders. According to a graphical approximation, we observed that wing shape differences between age groups differ among species. In the non-passerine species considered, juveniles have more pointed and concave wings than adults. In contrast, in the four passerine species, juveniles have more rounded wings than adults. However, the results for the C2 axis of SCCA (index of pointedness) do not completely agree with the graphical approximation. Our results showed that the C2 axis does not represent the same vector of wing shape variation in all species. The contribution of changes in C2 to variation in wing pointedness seemed to depend on the position of the wing tip, which is a good index of pointedness only when the wing tip is in the two most distal primary feathers. Surprisingly, the adults of some species do not have longer wings than the corresponding juveniles, because the feathers that define the wing tip do not grow longer during the first complete moult. we discuss the role of the first complete moult in changing the shape of juvenile wings into adult wings, and the implications of our results for the analysis of bird wing shape.",manoeuvrability; moult; predator escape; selection forces; take off; wing morphology,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp-7-supplementary-material-672-ardeola_1588660435.pdf,July 2020,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/672/articles/341-354/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp-7-supplementary-material-672-ardeola_1588660435.pdf

We investigated the effects of season (photoperiod), local climatic variability and prey abundance on the breeding season of two sympatric insectivorous birds that differ in the timing of reproduction and moult and have different migration strategies: the Moustached warbler Acrocephalus melanopogon and the Eurasian reedwarbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus. During a five-year period, breeding phenology was determined by examining bird incubation patches during standardised captures and food availability was assessed by invertebrate sampling. Time, mean temperatures and the abundance of some prey taxa were intercorrelated and all contributed to influence the breeding phenology of both species according to partial least squares regression analysis. Besides some interspecific differences in the effect of environmental factors on the breeding phenology, we found strong similarities between the patterns observed in the two warblers. This suggests that, in spite of interspecific differences in life history, the ecological mechanisms shaping reproduction phenology are similar in the two warblers and the same environmental factors are involved in determining the timing of their reproduction.",Acrocephalus warblers; bird ecology; breeding ecology; prey phenology; reproduction time,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp-9-supplementary-electronic-material_1589798477.pdf,July 2020,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/672/articles/371-385/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp-9-supplementary-electronic-material_1589798477.pdf

We analysed the diversification process and demography of the Canary Islands Chiffchaff Phylloscopus canariensis using two mitochondrial genes (cytochrome b and cytochrome oxidase subunit I). Although the species colonised the Canary Islands during the early Pleistocene, our results suggest a recent process of differentiation, which ran in parallel to the last glacial Maximum. Chiffchaffs from gran Canaria emerge as a unique lineage since none of the haplotypes found on this island were recorded anywhere else in the archipelago. Our findings suggest a process of divergence according to the gradual colonisation and subsequent isolation of nearby islands. Demographic results show a stable trend of Chiffchaff populations until the colonisation of Gran Canaria (ca. 15,000 years ago), where the species significantly increased its effective population size. Nowadays, the effective population size of the Canary Islands Chiffchaff is stable, which highlights the ability of Chiffchaffs to adapt to local disturbances related to human activities.

For instance, actual fuel load may have a decisive influence on departure decisions before a crossing of major geographical barriers, such as seas or deserts, but may be less important when crossing vast continental areas offering plenty of opportunities to refuel. The aim here was to test whether the relative influence of fuel load on departure decisions of the Common Reed-warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus, a long-distance migrant songbird, varies in relation to proximity to a geographical barrier: the sea expanse between Iberia and Africa. We expected that departure from southern Iberian stopover sites would be highly influenced by fuel load, since migrants would not fly to Africa until they had sufficient fuel to cross the sea. We used Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) models to test for the effect of fuel load on emigration (departure) probability from a number of stopover sites situated in northern and southern Iberia during the autumn migration period. Reed-warblers stopping over for longer than one day were more likely to depart if they were in northern Iberia than in southern sites. Moreover, large fuel loads promoted emigration from stopover sites in northern, but not in southern, Iberia. therefore, we found no evidence supporting the hypothesis that reed-warblers wait until they acquire large fuel loads before leaving their stopover sites near the edge of the barrier. this study shows that the same parameters may not act in the same way along migration route, in particular in relation to geographical barrier proximity.",Acrocephalus scirpaceus; Cormack-Jolly-Seber models; fat; food availability; fuel deposition rate; migration strategies; moult; sea crossing; stopover,,,January 2020,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/671/articles/15-28/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The high vulnerability of offspring to predation soon after fledging may induce a parent-offspring conflict with respect to the age of fledging, as parents would benefit more than offspring from reducing the period of whole-brood vulnerability before fledging. Parents also benefit from inducing early fledging through reduced commuting costs and a decreased exposure to predators. A reliable food resource near the nest could thus favour a relaxation of parental drives to induce fledging and enable an approach to the optimal fledging age from the offspring point of view. A population of a cavity nester, the European Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca, was offered food supplements (live mealworms) at the nest-box to randomly selected pairs throughout the nestling period and fledging ages were compared with those at nests without supplements. Provisioning parents were also trapped at the nest-box to estimate their willingness to incur predation risks in terms of easiness of capture (trappability). Fledging ages ranged from 15 to 20 days. Fledging was delayed in food-supplemented nests (n = 21) compared with control nests (n = 20) by one day on average, a significant difference. This was not due to the size and mass of nestlings at 13 days, which were similar under both treatments. Moreover, fledging age was positively related to parental trappability. Parents with easy access to food near the nest and those more willing to risk predation were those whose nestlings fledged at older ages. Parents apparently adjust the timing of offspring fledging to their foraging costs.",fledgling flight capacity; food supplementation; parental foraging costs; parent-offspring conflict,,,January 2020,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/671/articles/29-38/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The advent of genetic techniques allowed combining social and genetic data, providing a more comprehensive view of reproductive strategies. In obligate avian brood parasites, the lack of constraints derived from offspring care allows for great plasticity of the mating system in response to changes in socio-ecological conditions. This potential for intraspecific variation makes brood parasites ideal model species to investigate the evolution of reproductive behaviour. We simultaneously studied for the first time social and genetic patterns of reproduction of the Great Spotted Cuckoo Clamator glandarius, combining radio-tracking and behavioural observations in the field with genetic parentage analyses. Our results reveal that loose pair bonds can be maintained in this species despite high levels of genetic polygamy and lack of territoriality, possibly because of the need of intra-pair cooperation for finding and parasitising the nests of its large hosts: the Carrion Crow Corvus corone and the Eurasian magpie Pica pica. We also found that cuckoos mostly ranged around suitable foraging grounds, but females moved larger distances to find host nests to parasitise. Comparison of our results with previous reports on different populations also suggests a plasticity of Great Spotted Cuckoo territorial behaviour that may depend on population density, host choice and distribution of host nests",Clamator glandarius; Great Spotted Cuckoo; home range; pair bonds; social interaction; territoriality,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp-04-supplementary-electronic-material-bolopo-d-et-al_1579186138.pdf,January 2020,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/671/articles/39-56/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp-04-supplementary-electronic-material-bolopo-d-et-al_1579186138.pdf

However, due to the lack of recoveries of ringed individuals along the East Asian migratory flyway, and the size-dependent limitation on the use of geolocators, studies of the migration routes of small leaf-warblers are scarce. The only promising method is flight range estimation by using biometric parameters to identify migration distances and locate possible stopover sites along the flyway. The aim of this study was to estimate the flight ranges of migrant Radde’s warblers Phylloscopus schwarzi, Dusky Warblers P. fuscatus and Pallas’s Leaf-warblers P. proregulus at a stopover site next to Lake Baikal, Russia. For the analyses, we used the body mass, fat score and wing-length data of 809 individuals, which were trapped with mist-nets during the autumn migration periods between 2012 and 2017. Our results show that body mass, but not wing length, increased significantly among individuals with increasing fat scores in all study species. The estimated flight ranges of Pallas’s Leaf-warbler (724km) and Radde’s Warbler (510km) were similar to those of birds studied in a different part of Siberia, and the number of calculated stopovers was also similar between the two areas. In contrast, Dusky Warblers trapped at our study site were estimated to fly shorter distances (217km) and therefore must have stopped more frequently on their way to the wintering grounds.",Radde’s warblers; Dusky Warblers; Leaf-warblers,,,January 2020,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/671/articles/57-67/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantities of extracted protoporphyrin and biliverdin (the main eggshell pigments) were lower when using a strong acid after application of a weak acid.

The bottom of the mist-net is positioned on the ground facing the V inwards and staked to prevent birds from escaping. Birds are lured inside the V using playback and driven into the mist-nets by two people that monitor bird responses and react accordingly. We tested this method across the Neotropical region with six species of Laterallus crakes, capturing 20 individuals in 20 attempts, comprising three Grey-breasted Crakes L. exilis, three Black-banded Crakes L. fasciatus (= Porzanafasciata), five Red-and-white Crakes L. leucopyrrhus, three Rufous-sided Crakes L. melanophaius, four Ruddy Crakes L. ruber and two Rufous-faced Crakes L. xenopterus.

In colonial species, social environments may influence the activities of breeders. Here we compared patterns of mate effort in theWhiskered tern Chlidonias hybrida, throughout breeding in two regions that differed greatly in colonynest density. this species builds large floating nesting platforms on aquatic plant beds. accordingly, we explored whether nest building was sex-specific and influenced the activities of breeders throughout the season. In both regions, parental effort was indeed differentiated by sex; males invested strongly in nest-material delivery and mate provisioning during the nest-building stage, and females displayed increased investment during chick rearing. Contrary to expectations, courtship feeding and social interactions were less frequent in the region with high nest density. Our findings demonstrate that each parent clearly adjusted its reproductive effort throughout the season, whereas the contrast in social conditions between the two study regions weakly affected the activities of breeders.",behavioural observations; biparental care; Chlidonias hybrida; coloniality; nest-building tern; nest density,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/sc-06-supplementary-material_1579187396.pdf,January 2020,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/671/articles/113-125/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/sc-06-supplementary-material_1579187396.pdf

The range, amounts and organisation of materials used to construct nest walls hampers our understanding of the degree to which they provide insulation during incubation. This experimental study used temperature loggers in a model system to test the insulative properties of materials extracted from bird nests to determine: 1) whether differences existed in terms of insulation, and 2) if the position of a material mattered when two materials were tested in combination. animalderived materials offered better insulation than plant-derived materials, whether tested singly or in combination. Halving the mass of each material did not affect insulation conferred by the material proximal to the temperature logger. Differing thermal conductivities of the materials in contact with the temperature logger may explain these results. If a bird strategically places an animal-derived material only into a nest cup lining then it may be sufficient to provide good insulation for the whole nest.

For the identified groups, we estimated the dissimilarity values, using both an ANOSIM test and the βSIM index. Overall, we observed the lack of an equatorial peak for species diversity of NSDF avifauna in the latitudinal gradient and identified 12 avifaunistic groups. The βSIM index among the NSDF avifaunal groups ranged from 0.05-0.73, showing statistically significant differences (R = 0.894, p = 0.001) in species composition among them. Species shared between two or three NSDF groups comprised a higher proportion (~38%) than those exclusive to each group (~23%). Only 35 species were shared between the 12 groups. This information supports a separation of the NSDF avifauna into two major groups (northern and southern), as well as the idea of connections during recent geological time among the NSDF in southeastern South America (the so-called Pleistocene Arc Hypothesis). We provide a scientific framework to contextualise the importance of each NSDF nuclei in terms of their avifauna, supplying an ecological basis for future conservation decisions in order to protect their diversity.",bird assemblages; community composition; endangered forests; reverse latitudinal gradient; species richness patterns,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/ar-1-prieto-torres-et-al-material-suplementatio_1554715868.pdf,July 2019,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/662/articles/257-277/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/ar-1-prieto-torres-et-al-material-suplementatio_1554715868.pdf

AGUIRRE",,"Many studies have focused on the colonial behaviour of birds but information on the processes related to the addition of new breeders to colonies is still scarce. The breeding parameters of new, young, breeders in a colony differ from those of experienced breeders initially. Hence, there must be an underlying process to synchronise such parameters of the new additions to the original colony values. To determine how this synchronisation process takes place, we surveyed a White Stork colony in the northern Madrid province (Spain) for five consecutive breeding seasons. Given the high nest site fidelity of this species, we established a relationship between nest age (new or old) and breeding pair age (young breeder or established adult). Newcomers occupy new nests whereas established breeders use old nests. We compared the laying dates at new nests over a 3-4 year period with those at the old nests in the colony to determine whether new breeding pairs were synchronising their laying dates to those of the existing colony. Young breeders require up to three breeding seasons to synchronise their laying dates with those of the established colony. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such a synchronisation process has been described for storks. Nest age should also be considered when analysing breeding parameters that may differ between young and old breeders.",breeding success; Ciconia ciconia; coloniality; colony dynamics; reproduction; synchrony,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/art-2-supplementary-material_1554993770.pdf,July 2019,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/662/articles/279-289/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/art-2-supplementary-material_1554993770.pdf

ENRÍQUEZ, Carlos GARCÍA-ESTRADA, José Luis RANGEL SALAZAR",,"The distribution of resident and migratory bird abundance across mangrove and marsh patches can produce dynamic and guild-specific habitat-use patterns. Using 32 consecutive months of point counts in a coastal landscape in Oaxaca, Mexico, we studied the annual cycle, non-breeding season (October to March) and breeding season (May to August) of terrestrial birds. For broad trophic guilds of plant-consumers and insectivores, we disclosed seasonal dynamics and assessed the spread of non-breeding season abundance across migratory habit categories and habitat types. To test for habitat-use patterns derived from hypotheses concerning specific trophic resources, we focused on subsets within trophic guilds: frugivores (plant-consumers that mainly eat fruit) and invertebrate gleaners (insectivores that mainly eat terrestrial leaf and stem invertebrates). Drawing on a resource-centred dietary requirement hypothesis, we predicted lower abundance of migrant frugivores in mangrove, where palatable fruit availability was expected to be low and resident frugivores probably exploited invertebrates to feed nestlings. Based on the competition-oriented nest predation hypothesis, we anticipated a higher proportion of migrant invertebrate gleaners in marsh. We recorded migrant birds in every month of the year. For 20 plant-consumer species, the non-breeding season density was highest among residents in mangrove (> 5 individuals per hectare). For 46 insectivore species, densities were > 5 and > 9 individuals per hectare for migrants and residents, respectively. Comparable average abundances in trophic guilds suggested both migrant and resident species were equally important. For 14 frugivore species, a higher proportion of migrants in marsh (0.90) than mangrove (0.03) resulted from reciprocal between-habitat changes in migrant and resident abundances, as predicted by the dietary requirement hypothesis. For 22 invertebrate gleaners, proportions of migrants in mangrove (0.45) and marsh (0.55) were comparable, as were abundances. Contrary to the nest predation hypothesis, any between-habitat variation in invertebrate gleaner nesting activity did not markedly influence non-breeding season abundance.",avian migration; guild hierarchy; habitat use; mangrove; Neotropical; nesting; temporal dynamics,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp-3-supplementary-electronic-material_1556200451.pdf,July 2019,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/662/articles/291-310/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/rp-3-supplementary-electronic-material_1556200451.pdf

We here assessed dawn chorus onset and peak times in two contrasting conditions of the urbanisation intensity gradient (i. e., intra-urban and peri-urban forested areas) of a Neotropical city, Xalapa in Mexico, assessing relationships with noise at sunrise and artificial light at night. We found no differences in dawn chorus onset or singing peak times when contrasting intra- and peri-urban areas. However, we found non-significant trends for earlier chorus onsets and peak times with increasing noise levels. Our results show no relationship between artificial light at night and dawn chorus timing, adding evidence to recent studies showing that light pollution does not seem to be determinant in the dawn choruses of tropical birds.

PEREIRA, Anabela AFONSO, Fátima MELO",,"The relative abundance of the Azorean Buzzard Buteo buteo rothschildi, both temporally and spatially, was assessed to determine its land use preferences and to support its conservation. The main aims were to compare its relative abundance between years, islands and localities and to relate these to land use in the context of habitat changes. Randomly selected plots were surveyed using two sampling methods: strip transect and point counts, to record any buzzards seen during the breeding season and to assess land use characteristics. The buzzards were most numerous on the largest island (São Miguel), and least numerous on the smallest one (Graciosa), as expected. However, we did not find significant differences in abundance among localities in Graciosa or between years in both islands. We only found local variation in abundance on S. Miguel. The overall population stability clearly favours the conservation of this Azorean endemic subspecies. Finally, we found that buzzards avoid industrial areas, urbanisation, natural vegetation and agricultural land, a finding that should be kept in mind by policymakers. These results may be used for landscape planning and management by authorities. There are several regional Management Plans with a spatial dimension but for land use classification the Municipal Master Plans have the discretionary power to classify urban and rural areas. Therefore, this information should be integrated into the decision process of the local classification actions. Future studies should include further habitat variables to assess their relationships with buzzard abundance, but also to extend the analyses to the remaining Azorean Islands in order to understand more deeply how this insular raptor responds to habitat changes. The results of these studies should strengthen law enforcement on land use sustainability and help to promote awareness among managers, landowners, stakeholders and the general public.",fixed width strip transect; habitat use; island raptor; point count,,,July 2019,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/662/articles/343-360/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also found that laying date was progressively earlier over the study period, whereas both clutch size and productivity have increased. The results show high reproductive success (82%), with a productivity of 2.67 fledglings per nest. However, this high productivity was achieved thanks to the nest rescue campaigns.

ROSCALES, Ana SANZ-AGUILAR, Jacob GONZÁLEZ-SOLÍS",,"Bird migration studies have been given added impetus recently thanks to the miniaturisation of tracking devices. However, tracking methodologies have remained impractical for the smallest pelagic species and so important gaps in knowledge still exist. In the case of the European Storm-petrel Hydrobates pelagicus, while Atlantic populations are thought to overwinter along the south-western African coast, the winter quarters of Mediterranean birds remain more enigmatic. We performed stable isotope analysis (SIA) of C and N on P1, S8 and P10 feathers from 33 adult birds captured in three Atlantic colonies and 156 adult birds in seven western Mediterranean colonies to infer their wintering areas. In addition, we collated all observational field data, both from peer-reviewed publications and the wider literature, to complement our inferences from SIA. Within the Atlantic, isotopic profiles of feathers moulted at the breeding grounds (P1) differed between birds captured at northern Atlantic and Canary Islands colonies, but were similar for feathers moulted in winter quarters (S8 and P10), indicating low migratory connectivity. Isotopic values of feathers from western Mediterranean birds differed from those of Atlantic birds and showed Mediterranean values for all feathers, indicating that the former overwinter in Mediterranean waters. Variance in the isotopic values was greater in winter than in breeding season feathers, suggesting that birds disperse over larger areas in winter. Isotopic values of feathers moulted during the non-breeding period could match a post-breeding movement towards the southern and eastern Mediterranean. This inference matches the distribution of the few winter reports, which are mainly concentrated in the south-central Mediterranean, mostly in the Tunisian Platform.

However, the effect that these marks may have on scatter-hoarder birds, and hence on the estimation of post-dispersal seed fate, has so far been neglected. In this study, we experimentally analyse whether different visual marks used to locate caching sites may affect the removal rate of cached seeds by a scatter-hoarder corvid, the Eurasian Magpie Pica pica. We used three different procedures (treatments) to mark the caches: a small wooden stake placed at 50cm from the cache, a large wooden stake placed at the same distance, and no stake (no visual mark). Dispersal of walnuts placed in feeders was monitored with radio-tracking, and assigning the dispersed nuts to each procedure followed a stratified process that allowed us to create similar conditions across treatments. We found that mark type did not affect the recovery rate of cached nuts, which validates the results of the recovery rate in previous studies of this system. Marking cached nuts with wooden stakes up to 20cm above ground as done in this study seems therefore to be an appropriate way to assist researchers to locate sampling points when studying nut dispersal by magpies.",magpie; Pica pica; radio-tracking; visual landmark,,,January 2019,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/661/articles/77-87/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tracked YLGs did not migrate. Birds remained mostly inland during the day (up to 60% of fixes) and barely 5% of the fixes were at sea. Eighty-eight out of 192 gull trips to the sea were in interaction with local fishing vessels, 91% of which involving purse seiners that were active at night. The diet of the adult YLGs consisted of refuse, fish and small petrels, whereas the chick diet included mainly fish. YLGs on this oceanic island are strongly dependent on anthropogenic resources, scarcely relying on natural marine prey. The desired control of this gull population could perhaps be achieved by the reduction of accessibility to organic waste.",fishing activity; GPS tracking; habitat-use; human waste; stable isotopes,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/sc-4-romero-j-et-al-supplementary-electronic-material_1549438830.pdf,January 2019,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/661/articles/101-112/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/sc-4-romero-j-et-al-supplementary-electronic-material_1549438830.pdf

Ospreys reached their final destinations (in eastern, central or south-western Africa) via Suez and Cyprus. We identified several stop-over areas along these routes. Ospreys mostly showed an intensive off-route displacement during their autumn migration, suggesting that they simultaneously explore areas while travelling. We observed high variability within individuals, which suggests that Ospreys continuously adjust their migratory behaviour according to different environmental cues and internal factors. However, the low repeatability may also suggest that each Osprey is consistent but that all of them change their behaviour in the same way. This is important because it means that the environment encountered along the migratory route may trigger the same response by all individuals.",individual variability; migratory routes; movement analyses; stop-over areas; wintering areas,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/sc-6-babushin-m-et-al-suplementary-electronic-material-_1549291666.pdf,January 2019,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/661/articles/119-128/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/sc-6-babushin-m-et-al-suplementary-electronic-material-_1549291666.pdf

However, in contrast to breeding and migration, relatively few studies have been carried out on this topic. This is particularly the case with the large group of birds of prey and is partly a consequence of a general lack of appreciation of the relevance of moult within the life cycle of species. This factor is exacerbated by the difficulty in obtaining large enough sample sizes in this group, since some species are scarce and birds of prey are almost always difficult to trap. Nevertheless, moult is an energy-demanding process that takes longer than the breeding cycle and, contrary to the latter, it occurs every year. We stress the importance of the annual moult process for providing a “fixed image” of an individual´s biology and underline its utility in furthering knowledge of the life history of each species. In this review we first outline the basic definitions necessary for understanding the moult process, and discuss current information on the moult sequence of European birds of prey, as part of a comprehensive review of the mechanisms of the moult in each group. Secondly, we summarise the main methods used to study, analyse and understand the moult, and indicate how to use these to obtain relevant information. Thirdly, we explain the importance of the moult in the life cycle of birds of prey, and how we can use this information to advance our understanding of the ecology of each species. Finally, we include a view of possible strategies that may be used to improve future research, thanks to advances in knowledge of the moult process.",arrested moult; definitive plumage; growth rate; moult cycle; moult score; moult sequence; prebasic moult; serial moult,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1730ms.pdf,July 2018,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/652/articles/183-213/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1730ms.pdf

The response (277 instances) to boat and pedestrian disturbances caused outside the breeding season was observed. FID was positively and significantly correlated with the mean body size of the species. The correlation between FID and flock size was also positive and significant, irrespective of the type of disturbance. FID values ranged from 27.9 + 15.6 m (mean + SD, N = 32) in Common Snipe to 140.4 + 48.1 m (N = 30) in Eurasian Curlew, pooling data for both disturbance types. The same ranking was observed if pedestrian and boat disturbances were considered separately; differences were species-specific. For six species, the data allowed comparisons to be made between boat- and pedestrian-evoked FID; the observed differences were not significant. Thus, boat disturbances during the non-breeding season did not evoke a stronger response among waders, in terms of FID, compared to pedestrians. According to these results, set-back distances, expressed as mean FID + 2 SD, are suggested to reduce the effects of man-made disturbances to waterbirds at a local scale. These distances range from 59-74 m for the most confiding species (Common Snipe, Kentish Plover and Ruddy Turnstone) to 121-267 m for the most wary (Eurasian Oystercatcher, Grey Plover and Eurasian Curlew). To protect the multi-specific and often large winter roosts from disturbance caused by pedestrians or boats, a higher set-back distance, 270 m, is suggested.",flight initiation distance; roost; shorebirds; tidal flats; Venice lagoon; waterbird,,,July 2018,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/652/articles/209-220/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results from 127 sampling localities distributed east–to–west along 600 km in northern Spain reflect local and regional effects on species distribution. Habitat patch size (the species prefers large patches) and summer temperatures (the species avoids warmer sites) are the two main environmental correlates of species distribution. In addition, the occurrence of the Red-backed Shrike decreased in the westernmost sectors of the study area. This result could be related to a peninsula effect potentially reinforced by the atypical migratory circuit of this summer passerine (birds arrive from the east). The conservation prospects of this peripheral population suggest a retreat to cold highlands as global warming increases, a reduction in suitable habitat patches due to forest encroachment resulting from rural abandonment and the reduced availability of individuals to offset local extinctions in the westernmost border of its European range.",habitat availability; migratory circuit; peninsula effect; peripheral population,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1732ms.pdf,July 2018,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/652/articles/221-232/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1732ms.pdf

Mario VARGAS; John E. FA,,"The international wildlife trade is a lucrative business. Although a huge variety of animal groups are trafficked, the Psittaciformes (parrots) are amongst the most traded avian groups. Deliberate or accidental releases of imported parrots have led to the establishment of feral populations in many countries. Far from their native habitats, parrots may cause economic and ecological damage, and may even favour the transmission of zoonotic diseases. Despite this, the links between numbers of imported individuals and the establishment of non-native populations is not well known. In this study, we analysed data on imports of two well-known invasive parrots, the Monk Parakeet Myiopsita monachus and the Ring-necked Parakeet Psittacula krameri, in Spain. We contrasted this information with the growth of known naturalised populations of these species from 1975 to 2015 and compared the success of these two species with other Psittaciformes imported in similar numbers into the country. We show that more than 190,000 Monk Parakeets were imported from Uruguay and Argentina, and almost 63,000 Ring-necked Parakeets were legally brought into the country from Pakistan and Senegal. For both species, wild populations grew exponentially following peak importation periods in 2015 (18,980-21,455 Monk Parakeets and 3,005-3,115 Ring-necked Parakeets). Even though imports of the two species were banned in Spain in 2005, wild populations are now selfsustaining. We argue that these parrot populations started from accidental and deliberate bird escapes, especially from birds originally captured in the wild. Although lack of more precise data makes it difficult for us to propose clear statistical associations between imports and established bird populations, we nonetheless suggest that the international trade is with some certainty the main cause for the origin of naturalised populations of invasive species in Spain. Our conclusions are useful to help manage similar animal groups that are numerous in the wildlife trade, especially for wild-caught social species.",biological invasions; CITES; Myiopsitta monachus; pet trade; Psittacula krameri,,,July 2018,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/652/articles/233-246/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used data from two constant effort mistnetting stations (2005-2013), and spatially explicit capture-recapture Jolly-Seber models. The Reed-warblers continued reproducing in a dry environment for three years after the start of a dry phase, despite progressive declines in productivity, and ultimately stopped nesting in the fourth year. After the recovery of water levels in subsequent years, the population required another four years to recover a size and productivity similar to those preceding the drought. This situation may be common in the near future given ongoing alterations of the hydroperiod in Mediterranean wetlands as a consequence of climate change and groundwater overexploitation.

Results indicate the collapse of the two populations, with a loss of 95% of breeding pairs over the last forty years. The trends cannot be only explained by tree and urban encroachment in the study areas.

The Argentine Pampas has been highly transformed by human activities. However how birds respond to the size of grassland patches and landscape matrices is unknown. We studied the effects of these on the abundance and richness of both specialist and opportunist grassland birds. In addition, we evaluated the patch size effect in contrast with unfragmented grasslands. We surveyed birds in small and large patches of Cortaderia selloana grasslands embedded within agricultural, planted forest, dune and urban landscape matrices and, specifically in spring, in unfragmented grasslands. The abundance and richness of specialist grassland birds in small patches were lower than in large patches, but richness depended on the type of matrix and was lowest in patches surrounded by a forest matrix. Extensive grasslands are a key habitat for grassland specialists during the breeding season. In contrast, the abundance and richness of opportunist grassland birds were higher in patches than in unfragmented grasslands, and showed a negative effect of dune matrix in winter. Our results enable prediction of how bird species with different habitat requirements may vary in abundance and richness depending on the size of grassland patches and the type of land use following grassland replacement. —Pretelli, M.

Avifaunal studies have shown that the population density of several species decreased as the proportion of cropland in the landscape increased. The Greater Rhea Rhea americana and two migratory sheldgeese: the Upland Goose Chloephaga picta and Ashy-headed Goose Chloephaga poliocephala, are medium-large native species that have been common and sympatric inhabitants of the Pampas ecoregion. We aimed to analyse and compare the current ecological niches occupied by the three species during the non-breeding season in the southern Pampas of Argentina, the region where their original distributions overlapped, using Ecological Niche Factor Analysis. The three species showed high global marginality values, indicating that they occupied only a specific subset of environmental conditions of those available across the region. Suitable areas for Greater Rhea were located in the west and south of the study area, overlapping grazing lands and native habitats. The three species responded to landscape composition and configuration, as indicated by the low proportion of areas with suitable conditions for these medium-large birds. Suitable areas for Ashy-headed and Upland Geese were especially concentrated in the eastern part of the area and suitable areas for Upland Goose were more widespread than those suitable for the Ashy-headed Goose. We provide compelling evidence of low overlap between the ecological niches of the three species in the southern Pampas, which highlights the need for specific management strategies to ensure the conservation of these emblematic species.",agroecosystem; Ashy-headed Goose; ecological niche; grassland; Greater Rhea; Upland Goose,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1723.pdf,January 2018,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/651/articles/25-40/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1723ms.pdf

Checkhing the accurary of the survey protocols used in common bird monitoring schemes,http://dx.doi.org/10.13157/arla.65.1.2018.ra3,Oscar GORDO,,"Common bird monitoring schemes have become an important tool in conservation biology because they provide useful information for assessing spatial and temporal variations of bird populations. However, recorded data may suffer from several observational procedures that cause error. In recent years, a robust mathematical framework has been developed to control for potential confounding factors affecting the assessment of the actual spatial and temporal variability of bird populations. Surprisingly few attempts have been made to check the effectiveness of current methodology empirically and thus to determine to what extent monitoring scheme data can provide accurate estimates of actual bird abundances. To check the effect of intra-annual variability of bird counts, I conducted daily surveys of House Martin Delichon urbicum and Common Swift Apus apus populations along a 2-km transect line in Tres Cantos (Madrid, Spain) between March and September 2005. The data recorded perfectly mimicked the information collected every spring by observers participating in the common bird monitoring schemes of Spain. Computer simulations with my data showed that the probability of recording the actual annual maximum of individual numbers was less than 9% by the available protocols. Simulations of protocols with increased survey frequency demonstrated that three or four surveys per year would be enough to increase the accuracy of recorded House Martin abundance significantly. However, at least weekly surveys in spring would be required to produce acceptable annual estimates of the abundance of the Common Swift. My results suggest that two surveys per spring are not enough in the studied species, due to the huge between-day variability of records. Such variability is primarily caused by the nature of the count data and the seasonal patterns of occurrence/detectability of individuals. Abundance data for swifts and house martins recorded in common bird monitoring schemes should thus be used cautiously due to its potential inaccurary.",abundance; Apus apus; citizen science; Delichon urbicum; line-transect; population; Spain,,,January 2018,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/651/articles/41-52/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Setting up an integrated programme of long-term ecological monitoring in North African farmland and woodlands, as well as integrating new technologies into monitoring programmes, is an urgent need.

Sex-specific differences in diet and behaviour have been reported in several bird species but there are fewer studies of foraging area size in sexually dimorphic bird species. Foraging area size should be greater in the bigger sex according to home-range size predictions based on body mass. We tested this prediction in a winter study of foraging area size in the Great Bustard Otis tarda, the most sexually size-dimorphic bird species, which forages in unisexual flocks. In this species the temporal pattern of a flock’s feeding intensity; the proportion of birds actively feeding (FI) and the size of the morning foraging area (MFA) of each sex are unknown. We recorded the behaviour and movements of unisexual flocks of Great Bustards during winter mornings and sampled food availability to take into account its effect on FI and MFA. FI increased and then decreased through the morning in both sexes, and was lower in males than in females. This sexual difference was greater where legume availability was smaller. Legumes were the most preferred substrate type. Consequently, MFA sizes were smaller in sites with more legume availability. We did not find sexual differences either in the size of MFA or in the selection of the two preferred substrate types: legumes and stubble fields. MFA and FI were determined to a greater extent by ecological factors such as food availability than by metabolic requirements derived from body size differences. These results obtained from a short-term study do not preclude an effect of sexual size dimorphism on MFA size and FI of Great Bustards over longer periods but show that the body size effect on foraging behaviour may be smaller than predicted only by SSD.",animal movement; body size; home range; optimal foraging; sexual size dimorphism; time-budget,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1711ms.pdf,July 2017,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/642/articles/289-303/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1711ms.pdf

Here we test the hypothesis that raptor passages across different areas of the Turkish Straits are similar in species composition as well as flight behaviour. We made simultaneous observations at the Bosphorus and at the Dardanelles in autumn 2010. We tested the influence of weather, time of day and flock size on the intensity and spatial shift of migratory flow as well as the tendency to cross the Dardanelles Strait rather than follow the peninsula. We also collected information of the flight altitude of raptors using an optical range finder. The species composition observed at the two sites was completely different, with eagles predominating at the Bosphorus and small and medium-sized raptors predominating at the Dardanelles Strait. Compensation for wind drift at the Bosphorus was species-specific, with small and medium-sized raptors showing a drift effect by crosswinds, and eagles showing compensation and overcompensation. Mean flight altitude was similar among species, while the response to weather conditions varied, being mainly affected by wind. In the case of Short-toed Snake-eagles, flight ability and response to weather conditions was also age-dependent. These results show that the flight strategies of migrating raptors are species-specific even if some flight parameters may converge as a result of risk minimisation. The differences between species and flyways probably reflect interspecific differences in the ability to fly over water.",Bosphorus; Dardanelles Strait; raptor migration; Turkey; weather,,,July 2017,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/642/articles/305-324/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this context we characterise the land occupation strategies of a Western Atlantic French coastal endemic bird: the Bluethroat Cyanecula svecica namnetum. Our study focuses on a key period of the life cycle of this species: the post-breeding moult. Capture and recapture sessions in intertidal habitats have allowed us to retrieve 26% of local breeders during their moulting period. The modeling of moult kinetics revealed that moult of flight feathers takes 37-50 days. A radio-tracking survey of moulting birds revealed exploitation by individuals of both the lowest and tallest vegetal formations of intertidal sites and exploitation of small home ranges (0.42-1.34 ha), typical of locations where trophic resources tend to be abundant and predictable. Analyses of droppings highlighted that Coleoptera, Aranea and marine crustaceans (Amphipoda) contributed most of the prey biomass consumed, amphipods being particularly selected by birds in active moult. Our results underline the importance of intertidal wetlands in terms of trophic opportunities to compensate for the energy costs of moult for the Bluethroat. Given the global changes already dramatically affecting coastal habitats, we emphasise that special attention should be given to the conservation of intertidal wetlands for marshland passerines of conservation concern such as the Bluethroat, and that restoration of adjacent coastal terrain is a promising development.",coastal zone management; diet; energy expenditure; home range; marshland passerines; moult; trophic resources,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1713ms.pdf,July 2017,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/642/articles/325-345/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1713ms.pdf

The diet of Woodpigeons in a mountain area of southern Spain was quantitatively assessed on a monthly basis during 2011 and 2012. The birds were sampled on their way to roost sites after they had finished feeding and the contents of their crops were subsequently analysed. Twenty plant species and five snail species were identified in the diet. The consumed items varied significantly between seasons. Thus, acorns of Quercus sp. were the most consumed item during winter, cereals dominated the summer diet and tree fruits predominated in spring and autumn. The Woodpigeons showed a preference for cereals and acorns rather than tree fruits and pasture vegetation.

ABBA; David BILENCA,,"Croplands are habitats with high availability of food resources for seed-eating birds. The use of particular fields by birds may vary considerably depending on crop type. Some crop stubbles hold high amounts of spilled grain after harvest, which may support seed-eating bird populations throughout the year. We examined the role of crop stubble type and biomass of spilled grain on species richness and abundance of seed-eating birds in the Pampas of central Argentina. During 2011-13 we sampled 166 stubble fields: 77 fields during the austral spring-summer of 2011-12 and 2012-13 (44 wheat and 33 barley stubbles); and 89 fields during the austral autumn of 2012 and 2013 (49 soybean, 27 corn and 13 sunflower stubbles fields). We recorded birds on a 700×100 m transect and estimated spilled grain on 1 m<sup>2</sup> of stubble cover in each field. Comparisons among species accumulation curves showed that wheat and barley stubbles had similar bird species richness in spring-summer, whereas in autumn, sunflower stubbles supported higher bird richness than soybean stubbles. Generalized linear mixed models revealed that the abundance of some seed-eating birds had significant associations with crop stubble types. Some species were positively associated with spilled grain biomass on particular stubble types. In general, these associations varied seasonally, being more evident in autumn than in spring-summer. Knowledge of bird species populations and their specific association with given food resources during periods when crops remain only as stubble could be a key tool to help plan management strategies designed to reduce bird impacts on agricultural crops prior to harvest, when they are most susceptible to significant levels of damage.",crop identity; croplands; granivory; pest birds; seed supply,,,January 2017,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/641/articles/31-48/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Distinguishing these cryptospecies is essential for obtaining accurate population estimates for each, which is especially important in the case of the Iberian Chiffchaff due to its restricted distribution. We re-assessed the discriminant methods available in the literature and propose some alternative traits to distinguish both species. We used information from 24 morphological traits measured in c. 6,700 individuals of the two species trapped during the autumn migration period in Doñana National Park, Spain, between 2004 and 2015. Discriminatory methods available in the literature were unable to distinguish the two species efficiently. Despite some biometric differences, morphological measurements showed a high degree of overlap and so could not distinguish between Iberian and Common Chiffchaffs. The best discriminatory factor at our study site was the passage date, since 90% of Iberian Chiffchaffs have already departed when the first Common Chiffchaffs arrive. Those traits associated with migration, such as wing size and shape and fat deposits, were also able to discriminate the species, albeit weakly. This result fully concurs with the trans-Saharan migration of the Iberian Chiffchaff in contrast to the Common Chiffchaff, which chiefly winters in Mediterranean latitudes. In conclusion, biometric traits are useless for discriminating the two species and we do not recommend their use. A comprehensive examination of colouration and plumage seems to be the only reliable way of guaranteeing the correct identification of these species in the hand.",autumn migration; cryptic species; discriminant analysis; identification; morphology; Phylloscopus,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1703ms.pdf,January 2017,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/641/articles/49-65/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1703ms.pdf

LÓPEZ-IBORRA,,"Appropriate survey design is essential to estimate population size reliably, especially for endangered species. Dupont’s lark Chersophilus duponti, one of the most endangered passerines in Europe, has been monitored using diverse counting methods. This variation in the methods employed may have a significant effect on the estimates of population sizes. The present study compares four methodologies cited in the literature as having been used for Dupont’s lark censuses: the Finnish line transect (25 m inner belt width), line transect (500 m inner belt width, a specific application of the transect method developed for the second national census of the species in Spain), mapping and point counts methods. We also determined the adequate number of visits needed to detect a reliable number of territories by the mapping method and analysed the effect of census month on the number of males recorded in line transects. According to our results, we consider that the mapping method, based on four visits, is the most adequate methodology for monitoring the species. However, for surveys in large areas the use of the line transect method during May and June may be more affordable. Although census date did not have a significant effect on the number of males recorded by line transect surveys, a larger number of males were indeed detected during May and June. Thus, censuses carried out in March may lead to greater underestimation of population sizes. Nonetheless, the best date for counting Dupont’s Lark may differ for populations located at lower altitude. Point counts and Finnish line transects should not be used for counting the species, since both overestimate population sizes by about 35%, according to the mapping method and line transect results.",bird density; Finnish line; line transect; mapping method; point counts,,,January 2017,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/641/articles/75-84/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CARPIO; J. C. CASTRO-CARO; F. S. TORTOSA,,"The simplification and homogenisation of agricultural landscapes has led to dramatic losses of farmland biodiversity. This decline includes passerine populations and one of the mechanisms that may be contributing toward this may be increased nest predation. Ground covers are agri-environmental measures whose objective is to halt the loss of biodiversity by creating high-quality habitat patches embedded in a homogeneous landscape by maintaining herbaceous ground cover within crops. However, although such patches are selected by breeding birds, they may also attract predators, and an increased nest density in small habitat patches would thus result in increased predation rates. We have therefore performed nest predation experiments with artificial nests in order to investigate whether the effect of ground cover on nest predation is density dependent. The experiments were carried out during the breeding season in 2014, in two areas of olive groves in southern Spain. We used two nest density levels, both in olive groves with ground cover and in those where the ground was bare. A total of 420 nests were placed, 226 of which (53.81%) suffered predation. Our results showed that 1) nest predation was density dependent in olive groves with ground cover only with respect to tree nests, while there was no density-dependent predation in bare-ground olive groves of either ground-based or tree nests, and 2) artificial nests placed on the ground were more frequently depredated (65%) than those placed in trees (29%), irrespective of either the presence of vegetation cover or nest density. This study suggests that variations in patterns of nest predation are determined by the identity of nest predators and their specific foraging behaviours in different landscapes and habitats. It also underscores the need to implement agri-environmental measures aimed at the conservation of farmland birds.",artificial nest; herbaceous ground cover; nest density; nest survival; olives groves,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1672ms.pdf,September 2016,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/632/articles/237-250/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1672ms.pdf

Sánchez-BARBUDO; Karl B. ANDREE; Carles IBÁÑEZ,,"Many bird families, including the Rallidae, are characterised by a lack of plumage sexual dimorphism and reduced sexual size dimorphism. In such cases, biometry may still allow the sex of captured birds to be determined. We investigated this possibility in the purple swamphen, a species for which biometric and moult data from southern Europe are scarce. We studied and measured a large sample of wild birds in order: 1) to assess the extent of sexual size dimorphism in adult and immature birds; 2) to determine the period during which plumage characteristics can be reliably used for ageing; and 3) to develop a discriminant function that allows purple swamphens to be sexed using a set of morphometric measurements. Ten biometric traits were measured for 421 wild birds that were also sexed molecularly. We used body and wing photographs from 425 and 232 birds, respectively, in order to classify bird age (adult versus immature, based on the evidence of immature plumage). For most measurements the overall size ranking was as follows: adult males > immature males > adult females > immature females. However, this ranking did not apply to culmen and shield width, because these were bigger in adult females than in immature males. Immature birds moulted gradually during the first winter. The best ageing criterion for immature birds was the presence of median underwing-coverts with whitish tips before the first complete summer moult (second-year birds). This extends the ageing period by another six months relative to prior knowledge. The discriminant analyses using six different biometric traits correctly assigned sex in 88% and 95% of immature and adult birds, respectively. Using only two variables (culmen and body mass) reduced correct sexing to 80%-92%. These equations are a simple and inexpensive way to sex purple swamphens of known or unknown age.

One landscape is naturally fragmented and has high connectivity, whereas the other is human-fragmented and has low connectivity. We tested whether the sensitivity of bird species to fragmentation depends more on the intrinsic characteristics of the birds than on landscape connectivity. Point counts were used to sample small and large forest remnants in each landscape. The abundance of each species in these remnants was used as a proxy for sensitivity. To test whether the two landscapes differ in connectivity, we compared the following landscape metrics: landscape shape index (LSI), proximity index (PROX) and connectance index (CONNECT). We analysed the sensitivity of 85 species, 51 of which occurred exclusively in one of the two landscapes. In the landscape with low connectivity we recorded a large number of sensitive species. Among the 34 species that occurred in both landscapes, 24 species (18 non-sensitive and six sensitive) had the same sensitivity. Landscape connectivity seems to be more significant when we focus on the bird communities as a whole. However, when we focus on the same bird species in different landscapes, intrinsic characteristics of species seem to affect their sensitivity to fragmentation more than does landscape connectivity, especially for bird species with lower sensitivity. Therefore, our results show that increasing landscape connectivity may not be the best tool for bird conservation in naturally fragmented landscapes. Nevertheless, it will be important to test further whether forest bird species are more sensitive to environmental degradation in naturally fragmented landscapes than in human-fragmented landscapes.",bird sensitivity; Brazilian Atlantic forest; forest fragmentation; habitat degradation; landscape connectivity,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1680ms.pdf,September 2016,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/632/articles/279-293/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1680ms.pdf

They are birds of arid lands and hence their chicks face problems of predation risk and shortage of food and water, exacerbated by the patchy and unpredictable distribution of these resources. We therefore hypothesised that sandgrouse would be more precocious at hatching than precocial galliformes and charadriiformes living in more favourable habitats. Patterns of growth for body mass, wing, leg and sternum were described for the black-bellied sandgrouse Pterocles orientalis by a logistic model. Post-hatching development was characterised by the ratio of exponential growth rate (EGR) to relative size (Ln(W/A)) (W: Weight and A: Asymptotic size) at a given age. Developmental trajectories, indicating the degree of the development of precocity, were derived from these relationships as the slopes of least square regression of EGR on relative size. We also characterised the post-hatching development of body size in terms of maturation time. Growth parameters were compared to those of the Galliformes and precocial Charadriiformes using interspecific allometric relationships. Black-bellied sandgrouse hatched with relatively well developed body mass and legs, which accords with their faster post-hatching maturation. The development of body mass and wing reached their asymptotic sizes on steeper developmental trajectories than did the leg. The mean growth rate constant for the wing was the highest compared to those of the sternum and leg which were similar. In contrast to the leg, wing and sternum showed biphasic growth patterns. The black-bellied sandgrouse shows growth rates and a maturation degree at hatching that are intermediate between their convergent Galliformes and precocial Charadriiformes. It exhibits a developmental strategy in which both precocial legs and wings allow early development of either walking or flying. This constitutes an adaptive strategy to arid environments with low and unpredictable resource availability and high predation risk.",arid environments; convergence; developmental trajectory; logistic model; morphometrics; posthatching growth; precocial; sandgrouse,,,September 2016,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/632/articles/311-327/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Agricultural intensification has led to the almost total disappearance of pristine wetland vegetation and the decline of bird assemblages. Relicts of saline wetlands and modified surrounding habitats were chosen to explore differences and similarities in the assemblage structure of birds inhabiting the habitat spectrum from natural relicts to new agricultural ecosystems, in central Argentina. The study area is in the Pampa region, in the sector known as Flat Inland Pampa. Specifically, it is located in Marcos Juárez department, southeastern Córdoba province, Argentina. We identified eight habitats with contrasting floristic compositions and structures and three bird count surveys were conducted during an annual cycle: January-February, July-August, and October 2013. Fixed-radius survey stations were established in each habitat. Sixty bird species, from 21 families, were recorded. The results in terms of species diversity and trophic guilds indicate that bird species assemblages are associated differentially with different vegetation communities. The highest values of bird richness and guild numbers were recorded in structurally complex natural vegetation environments.

A species of particular interest is the Eurasian wryneck Jynx torquilla, the only long-distance migratory woodpecker in Europe that feeds almost exclusively on ants. Its European populations have declined throughout Europe over recent decades. Wrynecks are known to winter in the Iberian Peninsula but it has only recently been shown that at least some of these birds originate from Central European breeding populations. Hitherto, the habitats they select in winter have remained unknown although it is plausible to think that they are habitat specific given the birds’ strong reliance on ants as their main food source. We studied the wintering habitat selection by wrynecks in northern Extremadura, Spain, with MaxEnt models. We found that they chose diverse, extensive, agricultural (irrigated) croplands.

The effects that ectoparasites exert on host fitness usually become evident after the complete elimination of parasites or a substantial reduction in their abundance. Among the most common elimination methods in ecological studies, the use of chemical insecticides is traditionally preferred. However, the application of several doses is usually needed because the efficiency of insecticides decreases over time. This results in increasing toxicity effects and disturbance of both parents and nestlings. In the present study, we tested the efficacy of Inesfly, a new insecticidal paint. Inesfly acts by releasing active water-soluble compounds progressively over a period, therefore having a longer-lasting effect than other insecticides. By applying this insecticidal paint inside nest-boxes used by blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus during the breeding season, we investigated its effect on the abundance of blackfly (Simuliidae), biting midge (Culicidae), flea (Ceratophyllidae), mite (Dermanyssidae) and blowfly (Calliphoridae) larvae. The insecticide significantly reduced the abundance of Protocalliphora azurea blowflies, while other parasites remained unaffected. Our results show that Inesfly was ineffective against ectoparasites infesting blue tit nest-boxes, blowflies excepted, at least at the dose applied.

Over the last two decades the Canary Islands archipelago has proved an ideal system for evolutionary biologists who seek to unravel how biodiversity arises and disappears. In this review we have evaluated the contribution of the study of Canarian birds to our understanding of how and why species occur and change over time. We focus our attention on both extant and extinct Canarian taxa, and describe how research on these species has filled gaps in our understanding of avian speciation and extinction. In addition, we discuss the necessity of revising the current taxonomy in the Canarian avian taxa, especially the status of the endemic subspecies, some of which might be better treated as full species. An accurate classification of Canarian birds is not only necessary for testing evolutionary, biogeographic and ecological hypotheses, but also for effective decision making about conservation and environmental management.

Twenty-five years ago, Stephen Rothstein emphasised that rejection rates differed markedly between potential host species in Europe and America. The much more complete information available today supports Rothstein’s conclusions, but also allows new ones, especially when considering host size. For instance, successful resistance, one of the three potential long-term outcomes of brood parasite–host coevolution, is considerably more frequent in small-sized European host species and in medium-sized and large-sized Nearctic host species, while this evolutionary outcome is rare among Neotropical hosts regardless of their size. These results have never before been discussed, despite the differences being spectacular: 17 out of 19 small hosts presenting successful resistance are from Europe and 16 out of 17 medium-sized and 11 out of 13 large hosts presenting successful resistance are from North America. Interestingly, many large Nearctic hosts with a rejection rate close to 100% are corvids. The high rejection capacity shown by large Nearctic potential hosts probably evolved as a response to a highly virulent extinct brood parasite, either a large extinct cowbird or an extinct cuckoo species, which went extinct after losing the arms race against its large hosts.",brood parasitism; coevolution; Cuculus canorus; egg rejection; Molothrus; successful resistance,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1670ms.pdf,June 2016,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/631/articles/35-48/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1670ms.pdf

Many studies on sexual selection identify potential targets only within the reproductive fraction of populations. Floaters constitute the non-territorial fraction of the population, according to the usual definitions. Floaters have been identified through exhaustive capture and marking programmes, removal and nest-box addition experiments, extra-pair paternity studies, acoustic marking and genetic studies. The literature shows that floaters may represent a considerable fraction of populations, especially among males. There is no clear evidence that size, condition or testosterone level is necessary for explaining floater status generally. However, the literature suggests that ornament size and expression are involved in territorial exclusion and may be either its cause or one of its consequences. There is some evidence that floaters survive and reproduce less well than territorials, and that changes from floater to territorial status are accompanied by changes in survival and reproductive rates. However, certain male floaters may obtain some reproductive success through extra-pair copulations. The possibility that floating constitutes a successful alternative strategy in some species cannot be excluded, although the current preliminary consensus is that floaters are ‘making the best of a bad job’. Floater status may be imposed by limitations in the availability of mates or breeding space resulting in skewed population sex ratios, polygamous mating systems, high population densities and increased demand for specific breeding requirements such as space in colonies or adequate nesting cavities. Predictions concerning the effects of these factors have not been conducted to date. Few studies have been able to clarify the duration of floater status in any population. For short-lived species, floater status in a single breeding season may in fact imply zero lifetime reproductive success. In males, the existence of a considerable fraction of floaters attempting to breed may select for intense territorial behaviour and competitive mate guarding tactics in territory holders and in aggressive extra-pair copulation and territory acquisition tactics in floaters. Interference competition from floaters may lead to density-dependent declines in reproductive success. In females, the attempts by floaters to attain breeding opportunities may have contributed to the observed propensities for female prospecting and for female-female aggression and the signalling of female dominance towards other females. Moreover, there may exist selection in females for signalling quality to mates in order to avoid being evicted by rivals. Excluding floaters from the analysis of sexually selected traits may severely affect sexual selection estimates because of biased sampling for large or more intensely expressed ornamentation. The importance of sexual selection may be negated or underestimated when in fact its action on floaters could be maintaining current levels of expression in the territorial fraction. Existing phenotypes should express, in their morphology, physiology and behaviour, the relentless drive through evolutionary time to avoid becoming a floater.",extra-pair paternity; ornaments; population density; reproductive resources; territoriality,,,June 2016,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/631/articles/49-78/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most species showed increasing trends (80% during breeding, 62% in winter), including both initally common and rare species, suggesting a positive effect of site protection policies that were mainly applied in the 1980s. Specialised freshwater species such as diving ducks and coots did not show population recovery, most probably due to the characteristic tendency of shallow lagoons to remain eutrophic even after several decades of the implementation of sewage management and water purification. In fact re-introduction of a diet-specialist (red-knobbed coot) failed but that of a diet-generalist (purple swamphen) succeeded. Waterfowl hunting and the abandonment of rural practices also probably played a role in the lack of recovery by some species. Population trends of breeding species were more dependent on local conditions than trends of wintering populations. Body size could also have some influence on growth rates because some of the smallest species of shorebirds and Laridae (such as Kentish plovers, little terns and black-headed gulls) showed decreasing trends in one or both seasons. Finally, a few species were gained for the system as new wintering species, probably due to climate warming. Our results suggest that growth rates alone are poor descriptors of population fluctuations, especially for birds and other vagile taxa, and that it is more appropriate to interpret trends when considering natural regions spatially, and when growth rates are analysed within the time scale of the theoretical logistic curve.",ecological drivers; environmental stochasticity; logistic curve; long-term trends; protection policies; waterbird counts,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1676ms.pdf,June 2016,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/631/articles/79-101/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1676ms.pdf

Today, we are living in a technology-driven era of biological discovery.

Major technological improvements, such as the development of GPS dataloggers, geolocators and other bio-logging technologies, provide a volume of data that were hitherto unconceivable. Hence we can claim that ornithology has entered the era of big data. In this paper, which is particularly addressed to undergraduate students and starting researchers in the emerging field of movement ecology, I summarise the current state of the art of individual-based tracking methods for birds as well as the most important challenges that, as a personal user, I consider we should address in future. To this end, I first provide a brief overview of individual tracking systems for birds. I then discuss current challenges for tracking birds with remote telemetry, including technological challenges (i. e., tag miniaturisation, incorporation of more bio-logging sensors, better efficiency in data archiving and data processing), as well as scientific challenges (i. e., development of new computational tools, investigation of spatial and temporal autocorrelation of data, improvement in environmental data annotation processes, the need for novel behavioural segmentation algorithms, the change from two to three, and even four, dimensions in the scale of analysis, and the inclusion of animal interactions). I also highlight future prospects of this research field including a set of scientific questions that have been answered by means of telemetry technologies or are expected to be answered in the future. Finally, I discuss some ethical aspects of bird tracking, putting special emphases on getting the most out of data and enhancing a culture of multidisciplinary collaboration among research groups.",animal tracking; Argos; bio-logging; computational science; conservation; datalogger; geolocator; GPS; movement ecology; PTT; ringing; satellite transmitter; telemetry,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1678ms.pdf,June 2016,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/631/articles/103-136/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1678ms.pdf

MORALES; Juan TRABA,,"With the aim to identify priorities in conservation-oriented research, this paper reviews the level of scientific attention given to steppe birds in Spain during the last 50 years. We surveyed scientific literature using Thomson Reuters Web of Science and the journal Ardeola, using the English names of 28 species of steppe birds and the word “Spain” as search terms. Every species was assigned a Scientific Attention Index (SAI), based on the number of articles published on each of them. In addition, a vulnerability measure (Vulnerability Score; VS) was calculated for each species on the basis of the trend estimate provided by the Sacre or Noctua monitoring programmes, or according to expert criteria. The sample gathered (432 articles) was a significant and thus representative proportion of WOS and Ardeola contents on the species considered. The most studied species was the red-legged partridge Alectoris rufa, with 83 papers (20.15%); while the least studied was the short-eared owl Asio flammeus (1 paper; 0.24%). The most studied knowledge area was Habitat Selection (92 papers; 22.17%), while the least was Niche/Climate, with nine papers (2.17%). Preferred habitat (grass steppe, shrub steppe or mixed) was not a significant factor in the level of scientific attention given to the different species. However, large-sized species (non-Passerines) were significantly more studied than small-sized ones (Passerines), indicating a research bias for the former group. Finally, no significant relationship was found between SAI and VS, which suggests that research effort has been allocated irrespective of the species’ conservation status. These results highlight the scarce scientific attention given to most steppe birds in Spain in spite of their overall high vulnerability, and for most of the knowledge areas considered. On the other hand, they also show the high relative importance of research carried out in Spain, in both the Mediterranean and world contexts. This work underscores the need to focus scientific effort on certain species, especially those that currently show more regressive trends or higher levels of vulnerability, and in most areas of knowledge.",Flagship species; grass steppes; Mediterranean; shrub steppes; scientific attention; Spain; vulnerability,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1677ms.pdf,June 2016,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/631/articles/137-150/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1677ms.pdf

A significant part of this growth has been achieved using networks to represent the complexity of mutualistic interactions between species of birds and plants, such as pollination and seed dispersal. Bird-plant networks are built from matrices whose cells account for the field-sampled magnitudes of interaction (e. g. the number of plant fruits consumed by birds) in bird-plant species pairs. The comparative study of mutualistic networks evidences three general patterns in network structure: they are highly heterogeneous (many species having just a few interactions, but a few species being highly connected), nested (with specialists interacting with subsets of species with which generalists interact) and composed of weak and asymmetric relationships between birds and plants. This type of structure emerges from a set of ecological and evolutionary mechanisms accounting for the probabilistic role of species abundances and the deterministic role of species traits, often constrained by species phylogenies. Although bearing structural generalities, bird-plant networks are variable in space and time at very different scales: from habitat to latitudinal and biogeographical gradients, and from seasonal to inter-annual contrasts. They are also highly sensitive to human impact, being especially affected by habitat loss and fragmentation, defaunation and biological invasions. Further research on bird-plant mutualistic networks should: 1) apply wide conceptual frameworks which integrate the mechanisms of interaction and the responses of species to environmental gradients, 2) enlarge the ecological scale of networks across interaction types and animal groups, and 3) account for the ultimate functional (i. e. demographic) effects of trophic interactions.",frugivory; interaction diversity; modularity; nestedness; pollination; seed dispersal; specialisation,,,June 2016,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/631/articles/151-180/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonetheless, they have attracted a strong interest from the point of view of conservation biology because many populations have been close to extinction and because of their recognised role in ecosystems as top predators and scavengers and as flagship species. Today, after more than a century of persecution, and with the exception of some vultures still very much affected by illegal poisoning, many populations of birds of prey have experienced significant recoveries in many regions of Spain and the European Mediterranean. These changes pose new challenges when addressing the conservation of raptors in the coming decades. On this basis, and from a preferentially Mediterranean perspective, we have focused our attention on the need of describing and quantifying the role of these birds as providers of both regulating (rodent pest control and removal of livestock carcasses) and cultural ecosystem services. Moreover, we revisited persisting conflicts with human interests (predation of game species) and call attention to the emergence of new conflicts with a strong social and media component such as the predation on live cattle by vultures. Also, the rampant humanization of the environment determines the need for new solutions to the growing, yet scarcely explored, problem of accidents in new infrastructures such as mortality in wind farms. Finally, we explored in depth the ecological response of birds of prey to large-scale habitat changes such as urbanisation and abandonment of marginal lands that are also expected to increase in the near future. We urgently need more scientific knowledge to provide adequate responses to the challenge of keeping healthy populations of avian predators and scavengers in a rapidly changing world.",animal ecology; birds of prey; conservation; cultural services; global change; humanwildlife conflicts; pest control; predation; regulating services; rewilding; suporting services; urban habitats,,,June 2016,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/631/articles/181-234/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thematic changes have followed trends of the general ornithological literature, without the journal specialising in particular topics or geographical regions. Foreign authorship decreased from 1954 up to the end of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, subsequently increasing again, a trend fuelled by coverage by Current Contents and the JCR, the establishment of English as the language of publication and recent Internet access though the BioOne platform. Ardeola is a traditional scientific journal, backed by a scientific society, whose future will be guaranteed by a reputation for rigour and quality sought by authors, reviewers and editors, supported by the members of the Spanish Ornithological Society and retaining its original objective: ‘to be a journal at the level of the best…, looking for a strong collaboration with foreign authors to promote the benefit of the Ornithology’.",authors; citizen science; editors; historical change; impact factor; referees; research topics; scientific societies,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1685ms.pdf,June 2016,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/631/articles/3-14/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1685ms.pdf

We found that during the course of one year, approximately 25% of adult spoonbills disperse and are seen 100 km beyond their natal area. However, this rate is roughly 20% if we analyse only the core of the breeding season (May and June). The extent of dispersal in the Hungarian population is greater than that in the Atlantic population, where the proportion of birds showing natal site fidelity is higher. This finding could be explained by increased unpredictability in the Carpathian Basin in the temporal and spatial distribution of food resources and in the water-supply of wetlands, as well as in conditions at breeding locations there. These factors may also explain the high dispersal rate of adults in continental wetland habitats compared to coastal ones. Furthermore, the minimum distance to natal colony decreased with increasing age of age groups when age group was included as a categorical variable, indicating that immature birds in the Pannonian spoonbill population tend to disperse further than adults. This also implies a higher degree of fidelity to natal areas among adult individuals. Our data showthat post-fledging dispersal of juveniles starts from late May and isnon-directional, and at least 12% of all ringed individuals were seen 100 km from their natal colonies before their autumn migration. The occurrence of a large number of long-distance dispersers of all age groups in the Carpathian Basin suggests the need for ongoing wetland restoration at landscape scales.",Carpathian Basin; colour ringing; Hungary; natal site fidelity; unpredictable habitat; wetlands,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1656ms.pdf,December 2015,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/622/articles/219-236/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1656ms.pdf

Biometric and body condition variables were studied for their relationship to geographical, climatic and productivity indexes. A higher proportion of adults and females were observed at lower latitudes. Common chiffchaffs were larger and in better body condition in sub-Saharan areas, coinciding with greater plant productivity and less annual rainfall. The selection of the southernmost areas by adults may be related to fidelity to more favourable sites. Southern and coastal locations offer better conditions for chiffchaffs, despite the challenges involved in crossing the Sahara Desert. Moreover, the greater skills of adults in finding abundant food resources may also drive greater relative abundance south of the Sahara. Greater body mass and fat deposits in birds wintering in sub-Saharan areas reflect higher resource availability and may imply that the birds are in better physical condition.",differential migration; migration ecology; morphometrics; Sahara; subcutaneous fat; wintering habitat selection,,,December 2015,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/622/articles/237-254/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J. CARPIO; J. OTEROS; J. VICENTE; F. S. TORTOSA; J. GUERRERO-CASADO,,"The red-legged partridge Alectoris rufa is not only the most important bird game species but also an important prey species for many predators in Iberia. However, its populations have significantly declined in recent decades, principally as the result of agricultural intensification on arable land. Its abundance has also undergone a significant decline in forested areas over the last few decades, where wild ungulate management and abundance have increased. In this scenario, we aimed to test the factors that affect red-legged partridge abundance in relation to high wild ungulate (wild boar and red deer) abundance in south-central Spain. The factors included as predictors were carnivore, wild boar and red deer abundances, vegetation features, nest predation rate and invertebrate availability. Red deer abundance showed a negative relationship with partridge abundance in spring (non-significant negative trends were also evident for carnivore and wild boar), whereas variables related to food availability (grass biomass, Hemipteran abundance and total invertebrate mass) had a positive effect in the same season. Moreover, deer and carnivore abundances and spring nest predation rate were negatively associated with partridge abundance in autumn. Plant biomass and Hemipteran abundance were negatively correlated with wild boar abundance, whereas maximum pasture height was negatively relatedto red deer and wild boar abundance. Overall, our results show that high ungulate densities may negatively affect partridge abundance, which may be mediated by (i) a reduction in food availability (invertebrate and herbaceous plant biomass) and (ii) nest predation by wild boar. This research has shown that current intensive big-game hunting management schemes in South-central Spain are often incompatible with red-legged partridge conservation, and that these effects should be taken into account when defining big-game management and conservation policies.",Alectoris rufa; food availability; game management; interspecific competition; invertebrates; red deer; wild boar,,,December 2015,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/622/articles/283-298/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We collected data on laying dates and clutch size in two great tit Parus major populations nesting in oak deciduous forest and urban parkland areas, only about 10 km apart, in central Poland over 11 years. The abundance of caterpillars, the optimal food of breeding tits, at both breeding areas was also quantified. We analysed long-term trends in the timing of egg laying and clutch size. We focused on the effects of year, habitat type, insect availability and weather conditions shortly before egg laying on the patterns of variation in laying date and clutch size. In general, our study supports earlier generalisations on urban and rural tit populations. In particular, our finding that great tits initiated breeding consistently earlier in the urban site than in the forest area supports earlier studies on urbanised birds. The mean laying date was strongly and negatively associated with air temperature between 15 March and 15 April in both habitats. Mean clutch size was lower in the parkland than in the forest population, at least partly in response to the greater abundance of caterpillars in the forest. A novel result of this study is that clutch size differed between habitats to a varying degree in different years, in association with a stronger response to caterpillar abundance in the forest than in the park. Clutch size tended to decline with the progress of the breeding season within years in the parkland site, especially in “early years”, but not in the forest habitat.",breeding phenology; clutch size; habitat differentiation; weather impact,,,December 2015,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/622/articles/311-322/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A census of potential nest trees was also performed to calculate Savage’s selectivity index for each tree species. We found 128 parakeet nests in 60 trees. The tree species selected by monk parakeets were cedars Cedrus atlantica, araucaria pines Araucaria sp. and palms (Butia capitata, Washingtonia robusta, Syagrus romanzoffiana, Phoenix sp.). Cedars were particularly selected as nest trees: they supported 40% of all nests and held more nests per tree than any other species. This is the first study to reveal that cedars and araucarias are selected by monk parakeets. Nest tree selection is a context-dependent process and it is guided by tree species and their structural characteristics and phenology.

Two age classes among non-juvenile dunlins were recognised: immatures (2<sup>nd</sup>calendar year) and adults (> 2<sup>nd</sup>calendar year). There was a significant male bias in the sample of 4,406 non-juvenile dunlins captured during their southward migration. Overall, 60.3% of immatures and 59.4% of adults were males. Particularly among adults, the proportion of males increased significantly after the start of autumn migration. The annual sex-ratios were consistently male biased, but varied somewhat and fluctuated in parallel for adults and immatures. One plausible explanation for the male bias is that males and females differ in migration strategy. Females may make longer flights and avoid stopover sites with unpredictable feeding conditions, such as the southern Baltic coasts, which provide low quality habitat. Assuming a balanced non-juvenile population sex ratio, the ‘missing’ females could stopover elsewhere in the Baltic or fly directly to the tidal areas of the Wadden Sea. The sex ratio in the study area may depend on wind conditions during the early phase of autumn migration. In some years, adverse weather may force more females than usual to stopover in the study area.",migration; Polish coast; stopover site; waders,,,December 2015,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/622/articles/335-342/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have analysed the possible reasons why the Spanish Government accepted the 1950 Convention at the same time as it passed a law that supported the indiscriminate elimination of different animals that were considered harmful. This latter law, which included most diurnal raptors, had severe consequences for the avifauna. Bibliographic research allows me to suggest that perhaps these seemingly contradictory actions were not casually made. Both originated from the same people and official government departments, whose new utilitarian orientation lacked scientific expertise and usually depended on forestry and hunting management, and the sociopolitical circumstances of the time. Furthermore, the 1950 Convention’s own limitations could have had a negative influence, mainly due to the difficulties of implementation and the absence of institutional infrastructure to lobby States into greater involvement.",harmful animals; history of conservation; hunting; international agreements; protected species; raptors,,,December 2015,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/622/articles/391-406/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spain), comparing censuses made at the same locations in the 1980s and during 2008-2012. Censuses were made inthree representative ecosystems: 1) Pyrenean oak woodland, 2) high-mountain juniper scrubland, 3) high-mountain summits. In a global change context, avian-community dynamics are related mainly to changes in two of the following drivers: climate change and land-use change occurring over the past 30 years. Our results show a continuous turnover of the bird community, with an overall 27% change in species composition, in an ecological setting that has changed little, especially in the high-mountain scrubland and summit areas. We detected an increase in species diversity relative to the 1980s, mostly in the Pyrenean oak woodland. Moreover, our results also show a sharp decrease in bird density during the 30-year study period, chiefly affecting the dominant species of the 1980s in the Pyrenean oak forest and in the high-mountain scrubland. In the high-summit ecosystems, the decline of alpine species has paralleled the uphill expansion of some mediterranean ones. The outcome of these processes is a community in continuous flux, both in composition and abundance, where interannual variability is similar to interdecadal variability. We conclude that the bird communities of Sierra Nevada are showing strong spatial and temporal dynamics that are now accelerating, perhaps because of global warming.",climate change; elevational gradient; land-use changes; long-term changes; passerine birds; Sierra Nevada,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1642ms.pdf,June 2015,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/621/articles/3-18/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1642ms.pdf

Javier MENDIOLA1,,"Some bird species can cause crop damage but the historical variation in the incidence of such events is poorly documented. We analyse the spatio-temporal variation of damage attributed to sparrows (Passer domesticus, P. hispaniolensis and/or P. montanus) at a regional scale in Extremadura (western Spain) over four centuries (1501-1900). Textual data were extracted from historical documentary sources using over 12,000 Books of Accords (Libros de Acuerdos) belonging to 203 municipal archives. Sparrow agricultural damages were estimated from reported actions to control sparrow populations and two simple indices were constructed to analyse the spatial (PI<sub>M</sub>) and temporal (PI<sub>Y</sub>) variation in sparrow plagues. We used these indices to fit geostatistical models and analyse time curves. We found 251 accords reporting sparrow plagues, distributed across 236 years and involving 47 municipalities. Most of these reports (97.2%) were mandatory impositions (repartimientos) on residents to deliver a certain number of dead sparrows within a fixed period, under penalty of a fine or imprisonment. Results show a significant spatio-temporal variation in sparrow plagues, which we tentatively relate to dynamic environmental and agroecological factors. The spatial index showed high values (PI<sub>M</sub> > 4) in certain cereal-producing areas, among which La Raya zone located in western Badajoz province was the best example. The temporal index reached maximum values (PI<sub>Y</sub> = 7.3) in the mid 18<sup>th</sup> century (1741-1770), probably because this was a milder period (within the so-called Little Ice Age) coinciding with increased food availability for birds. In addition, we also examine some sociopolitical, economic and historical features that could have shaped the plague indices. We particularly discuss the normative and legislative developments (e. g. mandatory impositions), the municipal activity itself (affected by wars and other historical events) and the bird conservation interest (which flourished during the final quarter of the 19<sup>th</sup> century). We conclude that textual data-based indices provide a suitable historical perspective of the agricultural impact of sparrows in Extremadura and of human perceptions of them.",geostatistics; history of agriculture; Little Ice Age; mandatory impositions of birds; municipal Books of Accords; Passer; protection of useful birds,,,June 2015,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/621/articles/19-33/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found a significant difference between the sexes in wing length (females mean: 174.7 mm, range 169-184; males: 177.0 mm, range 169-191), but because of extensive overlap it cannot be used to determine the sex of most individuals. Measurements of birds recaptured in following years did not differ with increasing age. Birds began the moult in July. Moult was estimated to last about five months, from July until November-December, and was not completed on our study sites. Females and males did not differ in the timing and progression of the moult during the season. About one-third of individuals did not replace the 9th or 10th (outermost) primary, with a complex pattern of retention and substitution in sequence year after year.

MORALES; Juan J. OÑATE; Irene GUERRERO; Leandro MELÉNDEZ,,"We studied the response to agricultural management factors of birds wintering in an unirrigated cereal farmland area of central Spain, examining the influence on species richness, abundance and community composition of different field-level and landscape-level agricultural management variables related to intensification. Our initial hypothesis was that landscape-level management factors exert a stronger effect on wintering bird species richness, total abundance and community composition than field-level ones. The particular responses of the most frequent species (skylark Alauda arvensis, corn bunting Emberiza calandraand meadow pipit Anthus pratensis) were also examined. Richer assemblages were found in more substrate-diverse plots with natural vegetation patches or in plots with higher yield crops, while the more abundant ones, dominated by the skylark, occupied more homogeneous areas dominated by cereals and arable land. As expected, landscape-level management factors explained a much greater proportion of variance in community composition compared to field-level factors (71% vs 29%, respectively). Species richness per sewas favoured by substrate-diverse plots containing patches of natural vegetation, but also by plots where cereal crops were more productive in the previous harvest, declining in more homogeneous plots dominated by cereal crops and arable land in general. Conversely, skylark abundance and total abundance increased as landscapes became more homogeneous and dominated by cereals and arable land, although the relationship for total abundance only approached significance. Results suggest that the current landscape structure and levels of agricultural production of cereal farmland in central Spain can host relatively abundant winter populations of seed-eating and open landscape specialists like the skylark, although certain levels of habitat diversity need to be guaranteed to ensure the maintenance of rich wintering bird communities.",agricultural intensification; corn bunting; fallow; habitat diversity; meadow pipit; partial least square regression; skylark; Spain; yield,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1636ms.pdf,June 2015,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/621/articles/49-65/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1636ms.pdf

This could be due to abandonment by the first female to lay, with subsequent replacement by another female, or to male infanticide. Clutch replacement is accompanied in some cases by evidence of aggressive competition between females and of destruction of eggs/hatchlings immediately prior to a new clutch being laid. This may indicate that clutch replacements are in fact nest take-overs by females after eviction of incumbent females. In the course of long-term studies of pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca iberiaein central Spain, I have found evidence of clutch destruction through egg burial and ejection and replacement during laying or incubation, as well as of female-female aggression. No male involvement has been detected. Clutch replacements occur with a frequency that depends on the density of available nest-boxes and is positively associated with the rate of nest-box occupation by the same or other species. Moreover, clutch replacements can be accompanied by female wounds or death and involve clutch destruction in all cases. Putative replacers within the area of highest occupation frequently display the white forehead patch that is more typical of males, which may thus be associated with social dominance in females in Iberian populations. Clutch replacements in cavity-nesters should be studied in detail to confirm whether they represent cases of nest take-overs by competing females.",breeding density; cavity nesters; clutch destruction; nest take-over; nest-box occupation,,,June 2015,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/621/articles/67-80/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the landscape scale, a significant spatial autocorrelation of the lanner population, corresponding to the longitudinal distribution of sites, was found, with the species occurring within the most xeric UTM cells. There was also a negative relationship between falcon presence and potential evapo-transpiration values, either in the coldest months or throughout the year. The same negative relationship was also seen with the surfaces of CORINE artificial areas, thus showing that the species has a low tolerance to any anthropogenic landscape. At home range scale, our predictive models revealed a preference for territories with steep slopes surrounded by natural grassland, sclerophyll vegetation, arable land and agricultural land. The lack of spatial correlation and the identification of specific preferred land use classes, suggests that the home range scale is more appropriate than the landscape scale for predicting the occurrence of lanner falcons.

GARCÍA DE LA MORENA; Manuel B. MORALES; Gerard BOTA; Joao Paulo SILVA; Anna PONJOAN; Francisco SUÁREZ; Santiago MAÑOSA; Eduardo DE JUANA,,"The term “migratory” refers to animals performing yearly round-trips between breeding grounds and post-breeding areas, whereas the term “sedentary” refers to those remaining the whole year in their breeding grounds. However, migration is a complex and varying phenomenon governed by genetic and environmental factors, particularly in species with wide distribution ranges. Here we describe and classify the seasonal movement patterns of 71 little bustards Tetrax tetrax, an endangered Palearctic steppe bird, radio- and satellite-tracked in the Iberian Peninsula. Four major movement patterns were identified, with 89% of little bustards behaving as migrants, among which 75% (summer migrants and summer-winter migrants) performed their first movement after breeding during the summer (mainly between May and July), whereas 14% (winter migrants) left their breeding sites in autumn (mainly between September and November). The remaining 11% were strictly sedentary. On average, summer migration started on June 14th, and winter migration on October 3rd, while pre-breeding migration started on March 23rd. Summer migration occurred in most Iberian regions, although it was mainly found in semiarid Mesomediterranean areas. Winter migration occurred only in the northern half of the Peninsula, being the only pattern found in Subatlantic and highland areas. All winter migrants wintered in Thermomediterranean localities of southern Iberia. The sedentary pattern was found only in the Semiarid Mesomediterranean and Thermomediterranean sectors. This is a good example of complex intraspecific variation in the migratory behaviour of a species that occupies a diverse range of environments. The variability of movement patterns of Iberian little bustards is much greater than previously thought and should be taken into account in conservation programmes for the species.",climate seasonality; Mediterranean climate; Portugal; satellite tracking; Spain,,,June 2015,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/621/articles/95-112/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nests were mostly located in shallow waters, close to the shore (98.3 ± 37.9 cm), in vegetation dominated by Scirpus lacustris. The egg-laying period started at the end of March and extended for four months until the end of July. Overall, the mean clutch size was 4.7 ± 1.1 (N = 154) with a modal clutch of 5. There was a seasonal decline in both egg volume and clutch size. The overall nesting success was 60% and the chief causes of nest failure were predation (52%) and adverse weather (20%). Breeding outcome was influenced by water depth, nest size and year of breeding. Predation and nest flooding markedly varied between years. Larger nests had a higher nesting success than smaller ones. Likewise, nests located at greater water depth (further from the shore) succeeded better than ones located in shallower water. As the little grebe forages preferentially in shallow waters, these results suggest that optimal nesting locations may be the result of a trade-off between conflicting selection pressures such as foraging efficiency (better in shallow waters) and nest predation risk (greater in shallow waters).",breeding ecology; clutch size; Lake Tonga; nesting success; North Africa; waterbirds; wetlands,,,June 2015,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/621/articles/113-124/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Natal home ranges were larger for juveniles fledged at artificial than natural sites and the distance moved by juveniles during PFDP was positively related to fledging date and brood size. Duration of the PFDP was estimated as 40 days (range: 31-52 days). Over the PFDP, the best-fitting model to explain juvenile survival incorporated fledging date and nest site type, with juvenile survival being higher in early fledged broods from natural sites. Predation was identified as a major cause of mortality, especially in open landscapes where artificial nests were located.

We used five years of detection/non-detection data to parametrise incidence function models, in order to analyse the metapopulation dynamics of the species.

We also used repeated surveys during one year to calculate detection probability of the species in the system. The incidence function model used accurately predicted the proportion of irrigation ponds occupied and detection probability was high (0.88). Little grebes inhabiting the irrigation ponds performed as a metapopulation with extinction events related to pond size and colonisation events related to pond construction design but unaffected by isolation factors.

GUTIÉRREZ,,"During the course of their lives many vertebrates live and forage in environments characterized by different salinities and must therefore respond to changes in salt intake. This is particularly true for numerous species of migratory waterbirds, especially those that routinely commute between saltwater and freshwater wetlands throughout their annual cycle and/or within a season. These birds have evolved a suite of morphological, physiological and behavioural mechanisms to successfully maintain osmoregulatory balance. However, relatively little is known about the impacts of salinity on the distribution, physiological performance and reproductive success of waterbirds. Here I review the current knowledge of the physiological and behavioural mechanisms through which waterbirds cope with contrasting salinities and how some of the adjustments undertaken might interfere with relevant aspects of their performance. I argue that, because of their strong reliance on wetland ecosystems for foraging and breeding, waterbirds may be particularly vulnerable to climate-induced changes in salinity, especially in arid or semiarid tropical areas where increases in both temperature and salinity may affect their body condition and, ultimately, survival prospects. I conclude by offering some suggestions for future research that could take us beyond our current level of understanding of avian osmoregulation.",ecophysiology; energetic costs; habitat selection; immunocompetence; global change; migration; osmoregulation; phenotypic flexibility; salinity; trade-offs; waterbirds; wetlands,,,December 2014,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/612/articles/233-256/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The great tit Parus majoris an ideal species for studying this topic. Although it is traditionally regarded as a caterpillar specialist, in certain periods, e. g. during the breeding season, or areas, such as the Mediterranean forests, the great tit seems to show a preference for spiders. We conducted food choice experiments with captive birds to ascertain which of these two main prey types (caterpillars v. spiders) was preferred outside the breeding season when there was an opportunity to prey on both food types. In conclusion, we found that, regardless of any variation in the supply-demand ratio and the amount of food available, Mediterranean great tits showed a preference for spiders.",arachnids; captivity; caterpillars; Mediterranean area; prey choice,,,December 2014,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/612/articles/257-267/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data were collected over three consecutive years at a ringing station during the autumn migration period. We used reverse-time capture-mark-recapture models to estimate seniority, ?

We ran 14 models with the above mentioned variables, four of which were best supported by the data. In these, only rain showed a significant positive effect on ?, indicating that birds of any age class avoid flying during rainfall and prefer to interrupt their migration. These results are similar to those obtained from an analysis of day-to-day variation in first captures that was used to validate the usefulness of capture-mark-recapture models.

However, although it has become a problematic species in many Mediterranean countries, there is still no information about its status in Tunisia. The aim of this work was to assess the differential use of marine and terrestrial resources by the yellow-legged gulls breeding in an urban area on Chikly Island. Dietary reconstructions were performed through the analysis of regurgitates and d<sup>13</sup>C, d<sup>34</sup>S and d<sup>15</sup>N of feathers of fledglings. Contrary to most Mediterranean breeding colonies, and to our expectations, the mixing model showed that yellow-legged gulls from Chikly are above all marine foragers. Whereas the Lake of Tunis was the principal source of food in 2005 and 2007, chicks from 2006 were fed mainly with prey from the Gulf of Tunis. Although the Gulf is located further from the breeding colony and has less fishing activity than the Lake, our study demonstrated that it is used as an alternative foraging habitat. The Bayesian mixing model approach proved to be a useful tool for evaluating temporal variations in the feeding ecology of the colony, which is relevant information in the management of a wild species. This study also demonstrated the importance of isotopic variability among years for inferring diet diversity and food availability for the colony, thereby allowing demographic forecasts when trophic resources vary in abundance or the foraging habitat is disturbed.",carbon; nitrogen open air dump; regurgitates; seabirds; stable isotopes; sulfur; Tunisia,,,December 2014,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/612/articles/297-309/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some species are able to deal with these anthropogenic changes but a shortage of nesting sites may preclude them from breeding in cities. We conducted a baseline survey of the cliff-nesting burrowing parrot Cyanoliseus patagonus around Bahía Blanca (Argentina), estimating a minimum total of 1,361 pairs breeding at 24 sites (colonies) in 2013. The species showed facultative colonial behaviour, colony size varying between 1 and 300 pairs. Most colonies (68%) and pairs (74%) occupied human-made substrates, mostly quarries but also water wells. Colony size was strongly correlated to the extent of both natural and anthropogenic nesting substrates, suggesting an ideal free distribution of pairs according to the availability of nesting resources. Anthropogenic substrates have certainly allowed population expansion in what is a rather flat landscape with a shortage of cliffs and ravines, as well as urban breeding by a large part (61%) of the surveyed population.

Highly insulated nests included significantly more feathers than less well-insulated nests. Despite significantly lower temperatures at high altitude than at low altitude sites before clutch initiation, nest insulation quality did not increase with altitude. Moreover, we found that the date of clutch initiation was positively correlated with altitude. Birds may adjust to lower spring temperatures at high altitude by delaying clutch initiation, thus avoiding the need to invest in gathering highly insulating material.",cooling coefficient; great tit; reproduction; temperature; thermoregulation; timing,,,December 2014,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/612/articles/323-333/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Lower Vouga Lagoon in central-western Portugal offers an unusual diversity of natural and humanised biotopes in an agricultural-wetland complex mosaic. This study aimed to identify the factors that may influence the occurrence and abundance of a diurnal raptor, the marsh harrier Circus aeruginosus, in this kind of landscape. The marsh harrier is a top predator that is considered as an umbrella species, i. e. one whose conservation may also help preserve and promote biodiversity in general in its community. This study provides potentially valuable information on management and conservation strategies in both natural and agricultural areas. We found that natural habitats, such as reedbeds, are a key habitat for this predator, providing shelter, food and suitable nesting sites. Despite the general negative effect of human pressure on the occurrence of marsh harriers, the species seems to tolerate and even benefit from humanised environments, such as rice fields, which constituted the preferred foraging habitat during the non-breeding period. Nevertheless, the degree of disturbance should be carefully considered, since road density and agricultural machinery negatively influenced the presence of the species in the landscape, particularly during the breeding period. The preservation of the distinctive features of the studied mosaic is very important. It is also necessary to establish a conservation programme involving the local human community.",conservation; humanised landscape; Lower Vouga Lagoon; reed beds; spatial heterogeneity,,,December 2014,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/612/articles/351-366/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found significant sex differences in wing length, third primary feather length and body mass, with males being longer-winged and heavier than females; adult females also had deeper bills. However, high overlap in all measurements between the sexes meant the best discriminant functions based on wing length (all ages) and bill depth (adults) correctly classified only 87% and 75% of individuals, respectively. The mean potential non-stop flight range of autumn staging birds at the Loire estuary with high fuel load was estimated at 1,178 km for adults and 926 km for immatures.

FA; Juan Mario VARGAS,,"Surveys are very important tools for population monitoring, conservation and species management. Censuses aid in the sustainable harvesting of game species. Our aim in this study was to test whether some factors related to habitat and agricultural practices of olive cultivation may influence red-legged partridge abundance estimates. We investigated the effects of time of day and season of the year in which censuses are conducted, as well as of the reduction of herbaceous cover and the installation of irrigation systems, on red-legged partridge abundance estimates. In surveys conducted in winter, no differences were found in the estimates of abundance and density between partridge censuses at dawn and dusk. In surveys conducted in summer, the estimates made at dusk were significantly higher than those at dawn. The coefficients of variation of the estimates were lower at dusk in the two seasons. In winter, partridge abundance was not related to any of the factors studied. However, in summer partridge observations were related to the distances to the border of the olive grove, where herbaceous vegetation persists, and to water sources. There was an interaction between the time of the census and the habitat preferences of partridges. During the morning, partridges were more active and moved towards the borders of the grove. At dusk partridges were less active and returned to the olive grove. The results suggest that habitat use by red-legged partridges undergoes spatial and temporal adjustments in olive groves that seem to be related to some habitat features of the groves associated with agricultural practices. The temporal and spatial behaviour of the birds in the groves can influence the accuracy of surveys. Differences in the results of censuses carried out at dawn and dusk indicate that the two may not be comparable and suggest the need to take time of day into account when designing a survey.",bird census; farmland; habitat selection; Spain; survey design,,,June 2014,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/611/articles/31-43/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the genetic structure of the eagle owl Bubo bubo (Linnaeus, 1758) in southeastern Spain at two different spatial scales. Seven microsatellites previously described for this species were used, although only six loci amplified correctly. The observed low genetic variation could be explained by the short dispersal distance, high mortality rate and high degree of monogamy shown by this large nocturnal predator. As expected, the highest genetic isolation was detected in the geographically most isolated population. Significant genetic differentiation was found among study units separated by less than 50 km. The territorial analysis showed interesting connectivity patterns related with the gene flow and turnover rate of the breeding individuals. The lowest genetic diversity was found in the region with the largest population, which could imply incipient inbreeding.",connectivity pattern; genetic diversity; Iberian Peninsula; inbreeding; microsatellites,,,June 2014,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/611/articles/45-62/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

D’AMICO; Patricia M. GONZÁLEZ; R. I. Guy MORRISON; Allan J. BAKER,,"Migratory birds are sometimes known to make reverse movements to seek better fuelling sites before undertaking long-distance migratory flights across ecological barriers. Red knots Calidris canutus rufaregularly make prodigious migratory flights of ~ 8,000 km from southern South America to North America; these flights depend critically on the birds being able to store adequate fuel at southern staging sites. Knots staging at San Antonio Oeste (SAO) in northern Patagonia in Argentina could potentially backtrack ~200 km southwards to complete refuelling at Península Valdés (PV). We therefore analysed resightings of birds individually marked in SAO or the flyway at these two staging sites in 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010 to investigate whether reverse movements occurred between them. In the four-year period, 63 detected individuals backtracked south from SAO to PV in one or more years. These movements occurred in all years of the study thus demonstrating the annual occurrence of flights of ~200 km in the opposite direction to the normal northward migration. There was no significant difference in body condition (mass), sex or day of first sighting in SAO between birds that made or did not make reverse movements to PV. However, individuals (N = 11) that backtracked to PV from SAO had significantly lower hematocrit levels at the time of capture than SAO resident birds (N = 205). Because migrating shorebirds have been shown to restore low hematocrit levels before undertaking rapid fuel storage to power long flights, we hypothesise that red knots backtracking to PV were probably behind schedule on migration, and thus may have traded-off the small cost of a ~200 km flight for the increased foraging time and high quality soft-shell prey available late in the season at PV. This hypothesis helps to explain the later staging phenology of red knots using PV, and its role as an alternative staging area in the northward migration.",Patagonia; Península Valdés; reverse movements; San Antonio Oeste; shorebirds,,,June 2014,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/611/articles/63-76/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, we still have only limited knowledge not only of the wintering destinations of many Iberian breeding migrants but also of aspects as general as the migratory behaviour of the populations of many common avian species that breed in the Iberian highlands. We used bird-ringing data to shed light on the migratory status (migratory, partially-migratory or sedentary) of the breeding populations of 13 common species occurring year-round in a woodland located on an Iberian plateau (Garaio, Araba, Spain; 574 m. a. s. l.), where ringing activities have been carried out over the last 20 years. To assess the extent to which birds breeding on this site remain in the area during winter and/or are replaced by conspecifics coming from other areas, we analysed: (1) changes in relative abundance of birds between summer and winter, (2) the frequency of sedentary individuals (birds captured both in summer and winter period in the study area) in relation to the number of individuals captured only in summer (summer visitors) or in winter (wintering birds), and (3) variation in wing length among summer, wintering and sedentary birds. Our results revealed great variation among species in the intensity of migratory behaviour, and a general arrival of foreign conspecifics during the winter for most of the species studied. Likewise, our study represents an illustrative example of how long-term ringing can be used to shed light on the migratory status of bird populations.",altitudinal migration; avian conservation; forest birds; Mediterranean peninsulas; Palearctic Region,,,June 2014,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/611/articles/77-95/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fourteen variables with four vegetation dominance categories were analysed with respect to habitat composition, while occupancy of seven vegetation classes and 12 reed structural parameters were analysed with respect to habitat structure. The proportion of reed-cattails (Typha) measured by the habitat approach was the variable with the greatest likelihood of being the model that best fitted our data, but showed poor discriminative ability. The proportion of reed with tussocks was higher in occupied territories than in non-occupied territories. The main results are consistent with a previous study of habitat preference at a wetland scale and seem to be associated both with reduced predation risk and provision of nesting and feeding opportunities. management guidelines to enhance the presence of the vegetation classes preferred by the species are discussed.",habitat selection; predation risk; reed structure; wetland management,,,June 2014,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/611/articles/97-110/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies of wingbeat frequencies in hummingbirds have been undertaken with captive birds, most probably due to limitations of experimental design and/or less mobile equipment. In the present paper I describe how I used a budget camera, which captured 220 frames per sec (fps), to film hummingbirds in order to quantify wingbeat frequency under natural conditions in Costa Rica. With this equipment I was able to obtain detailed information about stationary hovering flight in three different species; the charming hummingbird Amazilia decora, purple-throated mountain-gem Lampornis calolaema and violet sabrewing Campylopterus hemileucurus. Wingbeat frequency was higher for the purple-throated mountain-gem and the charming hummingbird compared to the larger violet sabrewing. It did not differ between the purple-throated mountain-gem and the charming hummingbird, which are more similar in size. In the purple-throated mountain-gem I found a higher wingbeat frequency and increased body inclination while hover-feeding compared to hovering in front of the feeder; hence it may be more costly to hover while feeding. It is hoped that the video techniques used here will encourage researchers to record wingbeat frequencies across a range of animal taxa.

Adult bee-eaters preyed on a wide range of insect species with more than 97% belonging to the taxonomic orders Hymenoptera, Odonata and Coleoptera. We observed consistent seasonal changes in adult diet composition from the pre-incubation to the late chick rearing period. The dry mass proportion of dragonflies decreased remarkably in the adult diet as chick rearing started, whereas the consumption of small Hymenopterans increased by the end of the chick provisioning period. Additionally, we found differences in the diet composition of adults and nestlings. The higher amount of bumblebees and dragonflies in the nestling diet was temporally associated with a decrease of these components in the adult diet, indicating that breeding birds preferentially feed larger prey items to their offspring than those that they consume themselves.",,,,June 2014,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/611/articles/161-170/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article seeks to expand upon that discussion by providing further information on the nature and development of the international legal system, highlighting in particular the various factors that affect the practical impact that such instruments are likely to exert. It suggests in particular that, in addition to the rigour and suitability of the substantive provisions, it is necessary to consider the effectiveness of the mechanisms established for the treaty’s implementation, and the number and identity of the states that can be persuaded to participate, since the importance accorded to state sovereignty within the international legal order is such that relatively little can be achieved without their individual consent. It has taken many decades of experimentation for treaty negotiators to devise legal instruments that are capable of bringing about significant progress in the conservation field, and the pioneering nature of the 1902 Convention was such that its practical impact was always likely to be limited. Its true significance is therefore primarily historical, serving as a form of stepping stone to the more advanced instruments of the modern era.",avian conservation; early treaties; public international law,,,June 2014,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/611/articles/171-196/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bird morphology monitoring is conceptually similar to other programs aimed at recording the distribution of species and their habitats. However, it has one additional advantage: the same data used to describe variation can be used to infer the processes underlying observed changes by testing geographical or ecomorphological predictions.

The proportions of individuals of each sex and each age within the populations were assessed to explore differences in the wintering distribution.

That 59% of the godwits caught during the winter were male and that 56% of these were juveniles, suggest (1) strong age- and sex-related population structuring, and (2) a possible redistribution of these juveniles from the first winter to the next, or unequal survival of juveniles across the wintering grounds.",Limosa limosa islandica; Limosa limosa limosa; overlapping populations; sexual dimorphism,,,December 2013,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/602/articles/225-243/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The subspecies also differed in migration speed and stopover behaviour, with L. s. cyanecula travelling faster and refuelling during stopovers. The potential non-stop flight range was greater in L. s. cyanecula and increased with decreasing latitude, which is probably related to the need to overcome geographical barriers to reach the wintering grounds.

Understanding the temporal patterns of use of these habitats provides insights into their ecological requirements, and ultimately helps to direct efforts that ensure the birds’ protection. We investigated Magellanic penguin Spheniscus magellanicus beach attendance at Punta Tombo, Argentina, during three breeding seasons to understand the use of beach habitat by juveniles and adults in the breeding season, during the day and in response to physical stressors. We found that beaches at the breeding colony are actively used during the breeding season. The number of penguins on the beach increased as the breeding season progressed for both juveniles and adults, but their patterns of beach use differed. Juveniles arrived later in the season and their numbers on the beach reflected their moulting cycle. In all three years, juveniles left the beach in late January, consistent with their pre-moult foraging trip. Adult penguins, on the other hand, attended the beach in larger numbers during hot days, suggesting that breeders used the beach to avoid high inland temperatures. More penguins, both juveniles and adults, were on the beach during the afternoons, which probably reflects their foraging pattern. However, juvenile counts were less variable between mornings and afternoons than adult counts, indicating a more even use of the beach by juveniles. Beaches provide an alternative habitat for several key functions throughout the life cycle of Magellanic penguins but the birds’ temporal patterns of attendance probably depend on their age and breeding status and on the ambient temperature. Our study highlights the importance of the beaches surrounding Magellanic penguin colonies and provides guidance for the spatial layout of reserves where penguin colonies occur.",habitat; moult; temperature; thermal stress; seabird,,,December 2013,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/602/articles/279-290/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Terrestrial predators can also negate the protective quality of higher nesting sites by approaching from above in walls. It is unknown how terrestrial predation risks from below and above walls determine nest site selection in cavity-nesting species. In relation to this situation, we describe nest-site selection in common swifts Apus apus in the medieval city walls of Ávila, Spain. We recorded the entry size, hole depth and the horizontal and vertical positions of cavities. Most cavities were empty despite their size being suitable for nesting. Swifts nested in cavities at least 12 cm deep and with an entry between 3.5 cm and 13 cm wide. Nests were 3.5 m above the ground and 1.7 m below the top of the wall, although there were suitable cavities at the lower and higher extremes, respectively.

We studied this bird assemblage addressing the overall richness and presence of species of conservation concern, seasonal variation in species composition, breeding phenology and the importance of C. selloana habitats for birds. Species richness was high: 54 species belonging to 22 families, including six species of conservation concern: three classified as vulnerable to extinction (dot-winged crake Porzana spiloptera, black-and-white monjita Xolmis dominicanus and pampas meadowlark Sturnella defilippii), and three near threatened (greater rhea Rhea americana, bay-capped wren-spinetail Spartonoica maluroides and Hudson’s canastero Asthenes hudsoni). The highest species richness was observed in spring and summer, with peaks in spring and marked drops in autumn. The insectivore guild was the most numerous throughout the year. We identified 21 nesting species, four of which were of conservation concern, with a peak of reproductive activity during November.

Breeding territories in mixed-deciduous forest were characterisedby the presence of large-diameter pedunculate oaks Quercus robur. We conclude that the middle spotted woodpecker is expanding its range in the Pyrenees, probably due to an increasing presence of mature oak forests.

The results reveal that nesting substrate does not determine differences in productivity. Only those cliff-nesting pairs that breed in open-access areas have significantly lower productivity than pairs that breed elsewhere. Therefore, whether or not black storks nest on cliffs and on trees should not have a relevant effect per se on the productivity of the species but such an effect may arise in relation to the degree of human access to the cliff-nesting sites.

The exact content of the draft has been confirmed from different documentary sources, and it has been found that it differed, in part, from the convention to which a dozen European States definitively subscribed in 1902. Also, some of the changes made to the draft were very significant, since they harmed many species and significantly lowered the conservationist pretensions of the convention. The present account suggests that such changes might have been due to pressures exerted in the interests of certain countries, which demurred from the broad consensus reached at the 1895 conference. It is emphasized here that the draft agreed that year was fully consistent with the knowledge and views of much of the scientific community of the time, following the path indicated by some of the bird protection laws that were adopted during the 19th century by several European nations.",agriculture; environmental legislation; Europe; history of conservation; international agreements; protected species; useful fauna,,,December 2013,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/602/articles/385-396/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The classical explanation is that organisms differ in tolerance to urbanization, but current supporting evidence is insufficient because of the difficulties of quantifying such tolerance accurately in comparative studies. However, with information on the abundance of species along urbanization gradients, it is possible to construct simple urbanization tolerance indices that account for the fact that the density of a species in an urbanised environment depends in part on its density in the surrounding natural environments. The use of such metrics is likely to change our perception of how animals respond to the urbanization process, allowing a better investigation of whether urban communities are non-random assemblages of species and, if so, whether such non-random patterns are caused by adaptations that make some species more tolerant to urbanization than others.",birds; life history traits; neutral theory; urban ecology,,,June 2013,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/601/articles/3-13/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have provided evidence of the usefulness of raptor species as indicators of high species richness. However, other studies have shown that presence of similar species of predators does not always indicate areas of high diversity. We used atlases of vertebrate data in Andalusia (southern Spain) as different indicator sets to select networks of priority areas based on complementary species rarity. We tested the value of each indicator group as a surrogate for the conservation of all other target groups. We found that a reserve based on raptors is the best option in terms of all other species representation. Raptors performed well in the representation of other birds, amphibians, reptiles and, to a lesser extent, mammals. Complementary sites based on raptor species also show higher plant community diversity than other sites. Based on 395 different European monitoring schemes and Zoological Record databases we suggest raptors may be an easy and cost-effective group to monitor biodiversity compared with other vertebrate groups. Finally, our results point out that farmland landscapes are under-represented in the existing protected network in Andalusia. According to the present study, we suggest raptors may guide farmland habitat acquisition in order to better preserve terrestrial vertebrate species within the existing protected network in Andalusia.",complementarity sites; biodiversity indicator; reserve networks; surrogate taxa,,,June 2013,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/601/articles/15-28/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The specialised crab-based diet of Olrog’s gulls contrasts sharply with the generalist and opportunistic diet of the kelp gull. The characteristics of prey remains and the large size of stripped weakfish found in kelp gull diet samples suggest they were obtained from coastal sport and artisanal fisheries.

As a consequence, moult patterns have evolved that separate moult from other costly life-cycle stages and that exclude unnecessary replacement of the feathers. We studied two Spanish blackcap Sylvia atricapilla populations with the aim of elucidating variation and flexibility of their postjuvenile moult pattern. In contrast to most juveniles of this species, which normally undergo a partial moult both in captivity and in the wild, we found complete moult in 2 juvenile blackcaps. Complete moult was also inferred for another 7 birds, which were in active moult. Eight of these birds were trapped at a site in northern Spain and one originated from a partially migratory population from eastern Spain. This bird, held under the same environmental conditions as other 31 juveniles from the same population, moulted all primaries in captivity while the other 31 juveniles invariably undertook a normal partial post-juvenile moult. Therefore, it seems likely that complete post-juvenile moult observed in this bird was not induced by environmental conditions but had a genetic basis. Thus, we show that previously undetected variation among post-juvenile moult patterns is present in wild blackcaps and suggest that variation in the expression of important life-history traits could represent a potential reservoir for adaptive changes. This finding is in line with the great adaptive capacity of blackcap, repeatedly observed both in wild and in captivity.",adaptive potential; genetic variance; life-history trait; populations,,,June 2013,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/601/articles/45-57/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With this work, we investigated what factors affect the density of a multi-brooded bird species breeding in apple orchards, the song thrush Turdus philomelos, in three different periods of the breeding season in the Trento province, northern Italy. Birds were counted along transects, and analyses carried out using a Generalised Mixed Linear Model (GLMM) approach. A further analysis assessed the effect of conspecific occurrence and habitat variables on the changes in local density. Thrush density changed during the season, increasing from early to late period, and was mainly affected by tree height (positively), bare soil (negatively in third period), shrubland (negatively), wetland (positively), grassland (negatively), percentage of rows irrigated by droplet system (negatively), percentage of orchard covered by anti-hail nets (negatively), urbanised area (negatively in first period, positively in third period). Intra-seasonal variation in density was affected by tree height (positively), anti-hail nets (negatively), use of herbicide during the late period (negatively), difference in bare ground (negatively), and initial thrush density (negatively), the latter suggesting that best habitats are occupied first. Multi-brooded bird species may show varying density and changing species-habitat relationships during the breeding season, and their distribution could change during the period of reproduction. This pattern could apply to a large number of bird species, requires deeper investigation and could have important implications for conservation and management.",conservation; farmland birds; management; multiple broods,,,June 2013,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/601/articles/73-83/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The frequency of occurrence of nest or family locations within male lekking territories is also evaluated, as well as their association to habitat types preferred by females for nesting or chick rearing. A total of 28 nesting or brood locations (19 nests plus 9 families) were recorded over the study period. Habitat use did not differ significantly between nesting females and families. Both for the total sample (nests plus families) and the only-nests sample, the frequency of recorded locations differed between agricultural habitat types, with long-term fallows (older than two years) being the most frequently used. Young fallows (1-2 years old) were significantly more frequently used than cultivated habitats and ploughed-fields together, but less than long-term fallows in both samples. Nest plus family locations were more frequently found within estimated male territories than outside. Both in the total and the only-nests samples, locations within territories were found only in long-term and young fallows, the former being the most frequently used habitat type. These results from a mosaic cereal landscape provide further support to the role of long-term fallows as a critical habitat for breeding female little bustards found in other, more extensive, study areas, and reinforce the role of young fallows as an alternative breeding habitat when the former are absent or unsuitable. The strong dependence of breeding little bustards on fallows highlights the need to maintain their vegetation structure suitable as nesting and chick rearing habitats in order to prevent the species’ current population decline in Spain.",agriculture intensification; central Spain; exploded lek; fallows; nests; nesting habitat use,,,June 2013,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/601/articles/85-97/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bird richness and density were negatively associated with human density and the distance to towns along the river, suggesting a permanent impact on avifauna. Riparian forests had higher bird density. Four species were apparently sensitive to human presence: the anhinga Anhinga anhinga, the great white egret Egretta alba, the ringed kingfisher Megaceryle torquataand the southern screamer Chauna torquata. Thus, these species could serve as indicators of human pressure. Any management plan for sustainable development of the study area should preserve the riparian forest, consider the control of numbers of tourists and people in the river, and monitor the bird community, especially the sensitive species.",Anhinga anhinga; anthropic impact; Chauna torquata; disturbance; ecotourism; Egretta alba; Megaceryle torquata; wildlife management,,,June 2013,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/601/articles/99-112/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We estimated adaptive kernels to define the size and structure of the home ranges before migrating via the Strait of Gibraltar. Three storks died in Iberia before crossing the Strait of Gibraltar (one immediately after leaving the nest and two during movements across Spain before crossing the Strait of Gibraltar) and the rest moved to winter in Africa. Before crossing the Strait, the total distance travelled during the post-breeding period varied considerably among individuals, ranging from 100 km to more than 800 km. Mean movements per day ranged from 1.5 to 26.1 km. The tagged Iberian black storks began autumn migration between mid-September and beginning-October. Most storks flew to the Sahel without stopovers in 2-3 weeks. The mean autumnal migratory distance of all Iberian storks together was ± SE, 3,673.5 ± 516 km, and the migration speed was 208.6 ± 21.

Traditionally, habitat quality has been estimated by using demographic parameters or direct measures of habitat features, but these approaches are often not appropriate to link population dynamics and habitat characteristics. Alternatively, the study of bird physiological responses to environmental alterations has an extraordinary potential to recognise and quantify the problems or stressors that threaten species and affect individual fitness. The physiological state of birds can be defined from different perspectives. Energetics, biochemistry, immunology and endocrinology each offer a range of valuable tools within the framework of conservation physiology. Here I review some of the most commonly used physiological tools in comparative studies: such as measures of metabolic rate, plasma metabolite profiles, immune status, stress responses and stable isotope analysis. In spite of the obvious limitations in any research project, combining different methods in our studies would be a sound approach to identifying the mechanisms underlying the patterns observed in bird population trends.",biochemistry; endocrinology; energetics; immune status; stable isotope analysis; stress,,,December 2012,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/592/articles/197-216/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to the extensive development of wind power on land, currently several European countries have offshore wind farms (OWFs) in operation, as well as proposals to build many more. Considering that seabirds spend more than 90%of their life at sea, it is clear that they may interact with these man-made structures. To date, information on how to measure the impact of OWFs on seabirds is very scarce. In many cases it comes from non-peer reviewed reports made for specific assessment studies, very often carried out without appropriate standard methodologies, that raise questions regarding the level of confidence that they merit. In this paper, we describe the current political framework concerning the possible development of OWFs in Spain. Based on this, we comment on both the relevant variables necessary to assess the impacts of OWFs on birds and the methodologies available to collect those variables in the field, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each method. We show the importance of collision risk models, vulnerability indexes, cumulative impact assessment and population viability analysis as management tools. Mitigation measures that have the potential to minimise impacts are also summarised. We conclude with a discussion of the different steps to follow to attain a ‘clean’ development of offshore wind energy in Spain.",avoidance; attraction; collision risk model; cumulative impact assessment; flight behaviour; habitat modification; legislative framework; mitigation measures; population viability analysis; sensitivity maps; vulnerability index.,,,December 2012,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/592/articles/217-236/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, we did not find birds at the base of the Colombian slope of the Perijá Mountains, and confirming its absence there requires further study. Habitat loss at the three localities visited was high, with most remaining habitat represented by continuous gallery forests located on steep and humid slopes at higher altitudes. If conditions for population maintenance are only present in those patches, it will be necessary to identify forest fragments that help maintain connectivity between populations on the northernmost part of the Eastern Cordillera and the Perijá Mountains.

Old nest material may contain and/or attract more ectoparasites than fresh material. Therefore it is important to understand the effects of nest re-use on the abundance of different ectoparasite species of different virulence and their implication for breeding parameters and nestling condition. We studied the consequences of nest re-use in a population of pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca breeding in central Spain by offering them both nestboxes with old nest material and cleaned nest-boxes. We monitored breeding activity from the early stages of nest construction until fledging, and then finally removed nests to estimate ectoparasite abundances. Occupation rates were similar for both treatments. We found that blowfly and flea abundances were significantly higher in old nests than in new nests, but the abundance of mites, the most virulent ectoparasites on our host study population, was not affected by the presence of old nest material. Nestling growth with respect to tarsus length and mass was not affected by nest re-use although wing length was marginally and significantly reduced by nest re-use. There was no association between ectoparasite abundance and nestling growth and condition.

The study area was a managed holm oak forest where suitable natural cavities for breeding were accordingly scarce. A large proportion of breeding territories was significantly associated with nestboxes located in the periphery of the patch and with large-holed nestboxes. The relationship between habitat heterogeneity (predicted by canopy cover of holm oaks and tree numbers) and breeding performance (egg-laying date, clutch size, hatching success, fledging success and breeding success) was tested. Egg-laying date was independent of predictors of habitat heterogeneity but was related to breeding success: earlier nesters achieved better breeding success than those breeding later. Clutch size and breeding success showed a negative relationship with canopy cover and tree numbers, respectively: both reproductive parameters were higher in the apparently suboptimal territories than in the optimal ones. These results are interpreted as an effect of the severe competition for cavities between all species breeding in the nestboxes and the reproductive output of nuthatch is density-dependent. The high overall breeding success achieved by nuthatches suggests that holm oak forest must be considered a high quality habitat for this species.",breeding performance; GIS; holm oak forest; nest-site selection; territory quality,,,December 2012,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/592/articles/267-277/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to fill a knowledge gap in the pre-migratory behaviour of purple herons Ardea purpurea, a species conducting a 3,500-4,000 km migration journey within 5-7 days, 12 adult and four juvenile purple herons were equipped with satellite transmitters in The Netherlands. The birds were followed during and after the breeding period until they departed for their migration. Based on the recorded positions, the location and the size of pre-migratory feeding areas were identified, as well as the duration herons used these sites. In addition, the location of and the distance flown to and from night roosts could also be defined. The results revealed that failed breeders started migration at the same time as successful breeders resulting in a longer pre-migratory period. After fledging, juveniles showed an initial “search period” before settling down at a final premigratory site, which resulted in later departure to Africa compared with adults. Most of the dusk- and daylight period (amounting altogether to 15-18 hours) was spent at the feeding sites. After breeding, most adults remained to use the same feeding areas but switched from sleeping in the colony to night roosts within feeding areas, likely to minimize the daily flight costs. Based on the daily foraging time, the pre-migratory period seems to be sufficient to deposit reserves for a migration journey of several thousand kilometres. Above this, our results generally highlight the importance of high-quality premigratory feeding areas for long-distance migrants without extensive stop-over periods.",Ardea purpurea; breeding areas; feeding areas; migration; post-breeding behaviour; premigratory behaviour; satellite transmitter; stopover site,,,June 2012,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/591/articles/3-15/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The occurrence and frequency of explorations further than 1 km from the release point generally increased with time, even though juveniles continued to frequent the vicinity of the release pens. The translocated ospreys showed marked aggregation perhaps because the period spent at the hacking tower could have reinforced the feeling of belonging to the same brood, promoting a consequent strong association among the young. Also, the absence of parents may have led juveniles to aggregate as a compensation behaviour for the lack of parental care.

The study area was surveyed from four-wheel drive vehicles driven at low speed (20-30 km/h) along predetermined transects, stopping frequently at prominent spots. The intention was to detect all the great bustards present in the study area. The great bustard population in Castilla y León during the breeding season of 2008 was 14,025 birds: 5,637 males, 7,760 females and 628 individuals whose sex could not be determined. The population was 34% greater in 2008 than in 1998 when the area surveyed in both censuses is compared. Population increases were recorded in all provinces except for Soria, where no birds were observed. Not all local populations within provinces increased: we detected population declines of over 10% in 43 (27%) of the 160 polygons surveyed both in 1998 and 2008, population increases of over 10%in 93 (58%) polygons, and largely stable populations (changes less than 10%) in 24 (15%) polygons. Provincial increases in bustard numbers were positively correlated with increases in the extent of unirrigated legume crops. The great bustard population in Castilla y León in 2008 was the largest in the world, accounting for 27-32% of the global population and about 47% of the estimated Spanish population. The spread of unirrigated legumes, crops that are promoted by agrienvironment schemes, may have fostered the observed population increase between 1998 and 2008.

In this study, the abundance of immature vultures and adults (both territorial and floaters) was estimated in the Aragón region, the core area of the Pyrenean population, to provide an indicator of the total Pyrenean population. Using artificial feeding stations specifically designed for bearded vultures as survey points, 25 censuses were conducted during March 2010 in which 873 sightings (106 of individually marked birds and 767 of unmarked birds) were recorded. By applying the mark-recapture method, the total population of bearded vultures in the study area during the winter period was estimated to be 328 individuals (95% CI: 279-391 individuals). Separate estimatesby age groups suggested a population of 129 immature individuals (95% CI: 107-160) and 227 adults (95% CI: 173-311). The adult floating population was estimated at 49 individuals and the adult nonbreeding fraction was 93 individuals. Compared to previous censuses, the results suggest that although the reproductive fraction is increasing, the total population still has some problems: the immature fraction is not increasing, as predicted in previous studies, and a high proportion of adults are not contributing effectively to the breeding process. Conservation measures should focus on these two issues to increase the viability of the Pyrenean population.",Population estimation; bearded vulture; mark-resighting; population changes,,,June 2012,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/591/articles/43-55/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ZOZAYA; Lluís BROTONS; Santiago SAURA; Pere PONS; Sergi HERRANDO,,"Wildfires are certainly a key natural disturbance to terrestrial Mediterranean ecosystems. After an intense fire different types of habitats revert to relatively similar open hábitats. This early successional stage has been shown to be used by many open-habitat bird species, which are able to colonise these new suitable habitats. By adopting a regional scale perspective, we assessed to what extent post-fire colonisation by open-habitat birds is constrained by the degree of isolation of burnt areas or the size of the burnt patch, and analysed the influence of the period elapsed since a fire on species colonisation. We focused on the Catalan population of the ortolan bunting Emberiza hortulana and estimated the amount of dispersal flux into a number of recently burnt areas as a measure of patch isolation, using regional data derived from atlas surveys and connectivity metrics based on graph theory. Our results show that species occurrence on recently burnt areas was primarily driven by the amount of dispersal flux, and to a lesser extent by the extent of the burnt area. Species occurrence also tended to increase with time since fire, suggesting that effective colonisation was partly driven by stochastic ecological and behavioural processes. We suggest that the prediction of species’ responses to disturbances on large spatial scales should explicitly integrate not only species’ responses to habitat changes but also information on dispersal constraints imposed by species’ ecology.",ecological networks; graph theory; landscape context; metapopulation theory; population sources,,,June 2012,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/591/articles/57-74/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HERRANZ; Juan S. MONRÓS; Pedro MORENO; Rubén PICULO; José VERDEJO,,"The use of biometrics in studies of migratory connectivity is still relatively infrequent in Europe. This is partly due to the fact that biometrics is a less accurate tool when compared to ringing recovery data, or such techniques as stable isotope analyses, use of geolocators or satellite telemetry. Combination with one of these (recovery data) allows us to test the usefulness of biometrics in connectivity analyses, as well as to evaluate/quantify the influence of migratory behaviour on phenotypic traits such as flight morphology. We used historical recovery data, together with flight morphology data obtained from a consistent collection protocol during a three-year ringing programme carried out at seven sites in Spain (within the eastern half of Iberia), to test the usefulness of flight morphology for analysing spatio-temporal distribution patterns of migrants at a population scale. Blackcaps Sylvia atricapilla were used as our avian model. Two hypotheses were tested: (1) whether migrant blackcaps use the shortest flyways between their breeding and non-breeding areas, so that blackcaps entering Iberia through more eastern flyways come from breeding regions further east, and (2) whether the species is a leap-frogging migrant, in which populations from more northerly regions overwinter further south than those of more southerly origin. Blackcaps entering Spain through the western Pyrenean flyway (WF) had more westerly origins than those entering through the eastern Pyrenean flyway (EF). Blackcaps captured in the WF had more rounded and shorter wings as well as relatively longer tails than those from the EF, indicating a more marked long-distance migration morphology in the EF. However, blackcaps from the EF did not come from more distant regions, so flight morphology was not linked to distance travelled from the region of origin. The fact that both recovery data and biometrics differed between flyways suggests that here flight morphology is an adequate tool with which to study population-associated connectivity patterns. No evidence of leap-frog migration was detected in the study area wherebiometric data were obtained.",Biometry; blackcap Sylvia atricapilla; population connectivity; recovery data; ringing,,,June 2012,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/591/articles/75-91/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The subspecies were Luscinia svecica namnetum, which overwinters within the circum-Mediterranean region; and L. s. cyanecula, some of which migrate to tropical Africa. Overall, we obtained 265 captures, involving 208 distinct bluethroats and 56 recaptures, at the Txingudi marshlands in northern Iberia, during the autumn migration periods of 2007 and 2008. Passage periods did not differ between both subspecies, nor did fuel load (body mass: 15.0 g; fat: 1.0), mass depositionrate (0.07 g/day) and stopover duration (15.3 days). However, late L. s. cyanecula showed higher fuel loads than early individuals, so these birds could potentially cover longer distances without needing to refuel. Mean fat score was low for both subspecies which, together with the very low rate of fuel accumulation, supports the hypothesis that Iberia is crossed in consecutive short steps.

These estimates have been generated using three different methods: extrapolation of published information on bird densities; a rough assessment of population size using data collected by volunteers during breeding bird Atlas fieldwork; and density values obtained from a bird monitoring scheme based on point-count stations. In addition, an estimateof population size for common breeding birds has been produced in Catalonia, a Spanish autonomous community, using data from a bird monitoring programme based on line transects. The estimated relative abundance of bird species was similar for all these methods but absolute values differed up to 30-fold. The differences between the two more comprehensive datasets showed that the most recent national estimates were on average nearly five times as high as earlier ones, and more than ten times greater for 19% of species. The differences between estimates were especially notable for species associated with urban habitats. Although the estimates span a period of about 20 years, change in bird populations across time was not the main factor driving the observed discrepancies. Differences in sampling design and data analysis were probably responsible. Particularly important factors that account for these differences would be: (i) the absence of sampling design and the limited availability of data in earlier estimates; (ii) the more recent sampling of habitats, notably urban environments and farmland, which previously had not been well surveyed, thus increasing the population size estimates of species living there; (iii) biases resulting from the choice of sampling sites by observers, (iv) the use of different methods to estimate population density. To improve future population estimates it is suggested that additional work is needed to understand the shortcomings of bird monitoring programmes that are the data source for population size estimates of common birds. The results should also be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals. Ultimately, a refinement of the existing monitoring schemes or even the implementation of new approaches may be necessary to obtain reliable estimates of the population sizes of common birds.",bird atlases; conservation; density estimates; distance sampling; monitoring programs; population estimates; sampling bias; status assessment,,,December 2011,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/582/articles/343-364/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In thisconnection, we present some new approaches developed in the Catalan Winter Bird Atlas 2006-2009, such as the stratification of density estimates using habitat suitability indices derived from species distribution modelling, and the consideration of detectability not only for common species but also for scarcer ones.

HAEMIG,,"The introduction of the great-tailed grackle Quiscalus mexicanus into the Valley of Mexico by Aztec Emperor Auitzotl during the years 1486-1502, is the earliest documented case of exotic bird introduction in the western hemisphere. This translocation was intensively managed and involved at least three different human interventions: (1) capture and transport of grackles to the Aztec capital, followed by release there, (2) supplemental feeding and (3) protection from human harassment and predation. Here I present new details of this ancient translocation gleaned from extant sixteenth-century manuscripts, and review what is known about each of the four stages of the introduction. The grackles were brought from more than one locality north of the Río de la Antigua (Gulf Coast region). After release at Tenochtitlan and Tlatelolco, they multiplied and dispersed. By 1577, they had spread more than 20 leagues, invading even areas between the Aztec capital and their native range. Complete protection of the introduced grackles ended relatively soon, either during the rule of Auitzotl or that of his successor Montezuma II (1502-1520). A related account of Aztec translocation of exotic plants can be used as a model to predict additional details of Auitzotl’s introduction of the great-tailed grackle. Like the Auitzotl account, the plant account shows that a method and ideal of Royal Aztec translocation was to prevent the loss of each propagule. To achieve this goal, gardeners with experience cultivating the exotic plants in their native lands were imported from the Gulf Coast with them, and elaborate sacrificial rituals were performed. Large numbers of each exotic species were translocated, increasing propagule pressure and ensuring establishment.",Ahuitzotl; alien; exotic; introductions; invasions; invasive; Mexico; non-native; pre- Hispanic; translocations,,,December 2011,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/582/articles/387-397/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fossil records indicate that the species was already present in areas further north before this historical translocation. Moreover, it is a very plastic species and human commensal.

The first raptor survey was undertaken in the 1970s, but until 1999 most surveys were circumstantial and non-systematic. Considering some of these species are globally endangered and included in Annex 1 of the Birds Directive, and that raptors in general are considered key indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem health, a systematic raptor monitoring programme was established by WWF Greece in 2000. This paper presents the results of this programme including the population status, trends and breeding densities of raptors from 2001 to 2005. Some 18-19 species bred in the area regularly, at densities ranging from one pair per 100 km<sup>2</sup> (e. g. long-legged buzzard Buteo rufinus and peregrine falcon Falco peregrinus) to 30 pairs per 100 km<sup>2</sup> (common buzzard Buteo buteo). The total number of raptor territories was stable with an average of 321 ± 15.5 territories (77 territories/100 km<sup>2</sup>) with no overall trend and little fluctuation. Although the population size has increased for several species since the mid 1990s, data from the first surveys in the 1970s suggest that some species are still recovering from the decline suffered in the 1980s. The populations of six species have remained stable since the 1970s, whilst five species, including the Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus, have shown a gradual decline. The black vulture Aegypius monachus was the only species with a confirmed increase, a further three species showing a probable increase. The long-term trend for four species, including the common buzzard, is unknown due to insufficient data from the 1970s.",birds of prey; buzzards; coexistence; conservation; eagles; Falconiformes; falcons; vultures,,,June 2011,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/58-1/articles/3-17/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prey availability was sampled in 2,084 1m<sup>2</sup> quadrats distributed throughout Olrog’s gull potential feeding areas. Gulls fed almost exclusively on three crabs: Neohelice granulata, Cyrtograpsus altimanus and Cyrtograpsus angulatus. Diet composition was similar between years. The relative importance (%IRI) of different crab species, assessed through pellet analysis, varied across the breeding cycle. During incubation, N. granulata predominated (>90%) while C. altimanus comprised less than 2% of the crabs taken. This relative contribution was reversed during the young chick stage (60%, respectively) and was 40-50% for both species during the old chick stage. Stomach sample analysis provided a similar pattern of %IRI values for the chick stages. Sizes of available crabs differed significantly between species, C. angulatus and N. granulata both being similar-sized but larger than C. altimanus. Gulls selected N. granulata during incubation and largely C. altimanus during the chick stages. Our study suggests that Olrog’s gull depends on three crab species, confirming its specialised feeding ecology during the breeding season. Their relative consumption, however, can change temporally, probably in response to restrictions imposed by the different requirements of adults and chicks.",diet; Larus atlanticus; Olrog’s gull; prey selection; seasonal changes,,,June 2011,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/58-1/articles/35-47/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Socio-economic changes in rural Spain have reduced traditional sheep grazing in juniper woodlands, which are now increasingly used for wood production. This has brought the opportunity to improve their carrying capacity for migratory thrushes. Here we explore the spatio-temporal patterning of fleshy cone production and the way birds track this resource. We also investigate whether fleshy cone availability constrains bird numbers. The results show sharp losses of cones during the ripening period, inter-site and inter-winter changes in cone production and the tracking of ripe cones by birds. Mean availability of ripe cones in poorly productive patches was insufficient to maintain thrushes in mid January and highly productive patches offered resources to maintain birds for around 12 days. This suggests an insufficiency of food in the woodlands to permit thrushes to complete the winter and to begin their return northward migration in March. These results are used to suggest some guidelines for improving the carrying capacity of these woodlands for migratory thrushes.",carrying capacity; food tracking; habitat conservation; Juniperus thurifera; migratory birds; seed dispersal; Turdus spp.,,,June 2011,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/58-1/articles/57-70/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blackcaps were mistnetted during the autumn migration period of 2005 at a locality in Northern Iberia (Loza) and another in Southern Iberia (Doñana). Blackcaps at Doñana had lower fuel loads and a slower fuel deposition rate than at Loza, and the estimated flight ranges from both sites were insufficient to reach tropical Africa. The stopover duration was similar at both localities. If trans-Saharan birds occurred at Doñana, they would need to refuel at other stopover sites in Southern Iberia or in Northern Africa before crossing the Sahara.

The nature of the feather mite versus bird relationship is controversial, with reports ranging from suggestions of parasitism to evidence supporting commensalism or even mutualism. In addition, little is known as to why enormous inter-individual variation in mite loads is observed within bird species. In this study we show that migrant European robins Erithacus rubecula differ in their load of Proctophyllodes rubeculinus and Trouessartia c. f. rubecula by a factor of 2 to 3 depending on the winter habitat that they occupy. Such variation cannot be explained as being due to robins from different geographic origins wintering in different habitats, as wing shape and stable hydrogen isotope ratios (inferring breeding origin) in feathers of those robins did not explain variation in mite loads. Furthermore, there were no age or sex effects on the number of mites, but abundance increased as winter progressed. Robins wintering in the best putative habitat had higher mite numbers and the fact that there was no correlation between mite infestation levels and either muscle or fat scores indicates minimal costs to the host and hints at a commensal or mutualistic relationship.

We studied the effect of nest site location: in bramble, elder or hornbeam, on breeding success as well as selection of different nest sites in the blackcap Sylvia atricapilla, a species whose nests are heavily preyed upon both by rodents and corvids. We found that breeding success differs between nest site types, with higher levels of predation of nests built in elder or hornbeam than of those in bramble. We also found that blackcaps select bramble when it is available within the nesting territory. Nests in bramble were better concealed than those in elder or hornbeam. Since nest height above the ground did not differ according to the plant species used, nest concealment was probably the main factor affecting blackcap nest survival.",blackcap; breeding success; nest site preferences; Sylvia atricapilla,,,June 2011,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/58-1/articles/113-124/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our main objective was to study the relationships between nest characteristics and breeding performance, and the possible between-year variability in these relationships. We used great tits Parus major as the model species and studied a population breeding in nestboxes within orange plantations in eastern Spain. The study only considered first clutches, in two consecutive years. Nests were visited as frequently as necessary to record basic breeding parameters. We measured and weighed all nests during the incubation period, took biometric characteristics of parents and nestlings (tarsus length, weight and condition, and parental wing length) and measured the immune response of chicks (phytohemagglutinin test). We used principal component analysis to reduce the number of nest variables to three relevant components. Overall, 2007 seemed to have been a more favourable year, with larger clutch sizes and heavier fledglings produced than in 2006. Laying date was earlier in nests with larger nest cup diameter, hatching success was higher as relative cup depth increased in 2007, and fledging success increased as overall nest size increased in 2007. The only significant relationship between parental traits and nest characteristics was that first year females built deeper nests than older ones. Females with longer tarsi and in poorer physical condition started laying earlier. Increased fledging success was associated with decreasing male tarsus length and fledgling condition was better in nests attended by older males. In general, nest characteristics were positively related to breeding success, although specific relationships between the different components could vary between years. These relationships have been more evident in a trophically “good” year than in a “bad” one.",breeding performance; immune response; nest size; parental traits; Parus major.,,,June 2011,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/58-1/articles/125-136/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 97 species of waterbirds were identified with 41 species breeding. Marked environmental changes in North Africa over the past two hundred years that are relevant to waterbirds have included wetland drainage, persecution, introduction of exotic fish, increases in open-air refuse dumps and climate change. These changes have affected waterbirds differentially with some species increasing in numbers and expanding their range and others teetering on the verge of local extinction. When examining changes in the present breeding avifauna since the nineteenth century or the mid-twentieth century, the guild renewal rates were 18.3% (with a net loss of 5 species) and 4.8% (with a net gain of 3 species), respectively.

KOSICKI,,"This work analyses reproductive data about the white stork in Western Poland, from 2003 to 2007 and shows how the main environmental factors (weather, habitat structure and NDVI) influence breeding parameters. Moreover, a meta-analysis of density and reproduction for 33 local populations in Central Europe was performed. The data come from 824 inspections of 227 nests. The population studied was characterised by the low density of breeding pairs 4.5 (2.8-6.6) pairs/100 km<sup>2</sup>. The median of the first and second arrival dates was 1st and 11th April and differed significantly in different years. Clutch size (mean 3.81) and egg measurements (71.55 x 51.56 mm) did not differ among years, a result that may indicate low inter annual variance in feeding conditions at the onset of a breeding season. The highest seasonal differences in breeding output (mean 2.96 young per nest) were found during the nestling stage, which is a crucial period for nestling production and, in consequence, breeding output. The number of chicks was positively affected by weather conditions, i. e. air temperature, and negatively related to precipitation. Meta-analysis of local stork populations in Central Europe showed that, despite differences in breeding density, breeding success was similar in areas of low and high human population. In the case of the white stork, breeding density might be one of the key factors that affects overall breeding success by depending on strong competition for food as well as nest locations",success; Ciconia ciconia; clutch size; habitat structure; weather,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1467.pdf,December 2010,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/572/articles/243-255/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A video-camera was used to record the prey used for feeding nestlings by adult southern grey shrikes of ten different nests. Nestling age varied from 5 to 13 days. The percentage of occupancy of each kind of habitat (vineyards, cereal crops, natural habitat, others) within a radius of 250 m around each nest was computed from aerial pictures. Prey availability was analysed with pitfall traps placed in three different habitats in the study area. Orthoptera were the most frequent prey (69.56%, N = 287), in particular crickets Gryllus campestris (85.5% of all Orthoptera). Vertebrates comprised 3.05% of the total prey. Orthoptera were positively selected by feeding adults in all the studied nests. Arachnida and Coleoptera were not positively selected in any of the nests and in fact were negatively selected in 50% and 90% of the nests, respectively. The percentage of feedings with Myriapoda, Hymenoptera and Dyctioptera were similar to the frequency of these prey in the pitfall traps. Myriapoda and Orthoptera were the largest prey, whereas Arachnida and Coleoptera were the smallest. Differences with previous studies from other location can be ascribed to the shrike’s adaptation to the transformation of the habitat into an agroecosystem since: (i) Orthoptera are highly abundant in vineyards, where the large number of available perches and the lack of herbaceous vegetation enable shrikes to capture them; (ii) they have a high content of proteins and water, and they probably favour a more rapid nestling growth.",agricultural areas; food nestling; Lanius meridionalis; Orthoptera; southern grey shrike; Spain.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1468.pdf,December 2010,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/572/articles/257-265/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fieldwork was conducted in an area of 500 ha between Palacio and Pedrún (42º 43’ 26’’ 42º 46’ 15’’ S-N, 5º 29’ 58’’ 5º 30’ 55’’ E-W, 900-1,000 m a. s. l.), in the Torío river valley, León province. Population density was estimated through line transects and mapping. Records of pairs carrying nest material in their bills, building a nest and carrying food in their bills were distributed in 10-day intervals. Nest-site selection was estimated using the Jacobs’ index. To determine nest success, only those found in the early stages of building were considered. To establish provisioning rates, each nest with nestlings was observed for a minimum of 3 h. The number of helpers at each nest each day was deduced from the maximum number of different adults feeding nestlings at the same time, subtracting the two individuals that formed the pair. Population density was c. 6-10 birds/10 ha. Winter flock break-up and pair formation usually occurred from the beginning of February, nest building during 11 March-10 April, laying and incubation during 11-30 April, and the presence of nestlings throughout May. Probably few pairs renested after failing to breed. The most typical habitats in the nest surroundings were hedgerows and oak woods. Two thirds of the nests were built in shrubs and the rest in trees. Rubus brambles were highly preferred plant species for supporting nests. Nest success was very low (c. 18%), and nest failure occurred mainly before hatching due to predation. No cases of helping behaviour were recorded prior to the nestling stage. Cooperative breeding was verified in 60% of the nests, and it occurred in all the habitats and vegetation strata. The final number of helpers per nest was between one and four, usually one or two. Values over 40 visits to the nest in one hour were only recorded when there was at least one helper, and over 50 visits with two or more helpers. In conclusion, (i) optimal habitat conditions for the long-tailed tit were found in the study area; (ii) several characteristics of the observed breeding ecology coincided with those well-described in similar habitats in the UK; (iii) the same determining factors for helping behaviour probably occurred in both locations, with great importance of low breeding success.

However, the usefulness of these features in identifying suitable areas for birds can be obscured by other factors, such as altitude, climate and regional landscape patterns. This occurs on large spatial scales (e. g. across latitudinal gradients), and also on smaller, regional scales (e. g. mountains). We explored how topography and vegetation affect breeding and wintering bird communities in mountain forests of the Cantabrian Mixed Forest Ecoregion (Spain), an area where many Palaearctic forest birds reach the southwestern boundary of their ranges. The work was carried out on nine extensive seminatural forests distributed along the northern slopes of the Cantabrian Mountains from near 400 m to 1,300 m a. s. l. Birds were censused in 78 line-transects 500-m long. Ten physiognomic and floristic variables were measured in each transect. The effects of forest variables, altitude and slope orientation on bird richness and abundance were examined with principal component analysis and general linear models. The results support that, at the study scale, the effects of vegetation on bird communities are very scanty and limited to a positive effect of oak stands on bird richness in winter. Altitude was an outstanding predictor of bird distribution, especially in winter, with the lowest-level forests having the highest bird richness and abundance. This pattern differed quantitatively among species with different foraging niches, since trunk gleaner birds were hardly affected by altitude, whereas the numbers of ground searchers decreased severely. The conservation of the Cantabrian bird communities requires the strict protection of the entire altitudinal forest range, and particularly the existing low altitude forests. Likewise, there is an urgent need to conserve all of the extant oak forests at whatever altitude.",altitude; bird richness; bird abundance; Cantabrian forests; oak cover; woody plant diversity.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1470.pdf,December 2010,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/572/articles/285-302/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the effects of a severe drought on short-term population dynamics of nocturnal birds, a threatened and declining group of species that has been little studied. We addressed three levels (i. e. species, food guild and assemblage) for three consecutive years. The highest fluctuation in abundance occurred for species which feed on invertebrates, and the lowest abundance corresponded to the year after the severe drought. Species that feed on invertebrates occupied different sites in the different season sampling periods, whereas species that feed on vertebrates tended to occur at the same sites throughout the year. At the assemblage level, species composition did not change between years. Patterns of site occurrence and population abundance in different years were mostly spatially congruent; thus, habitat features that are strictly space-dependent are more critical for explaining these patterns than other factors that change over time such as weather. The spatial segregation of little owl Athene noctua and Eurasian scops owl Otus scops is partially attributed to the sedentary character of the former and the migratory character of the latter. The low population fluctuations observed for most species make their conservation more straightforward since harsh years in relation to weather were not associated with abrupt population declines except for stone curlew Burhinus oedicnemus, a vulnerable species that should be prioritised for conservation actions.",abundance; food guild; occurrence; population fluctuations; severe drought.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1471.pdf,December 2010,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/572/articles/303-320/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study was performed in Soto del Real, Madrid, in central Spain (40º 44’ N, 3º 48’ W) from March to July 2007. Before the onset of laying in the population females were trapped and marked when visiting nest-boxes. Captures were discontinued when laying approached and observations were performed to assess the identity of females breeding at each nest-box. Nests were monitored from egg laying to fledgling. In order to measure yolk androgens, the first egg laid was collected in all clutches before incubation started. Yolk concentrations of testosterone (T) and androstenedione (A4) were measured by EIA kits highly specific for each hormone. Nestling reproductive value was estimated in relation to nest ectoparasite load by the fly Carnus hemapterus. We found that females in early clutches laid larger eggs with higher androgen concentration than females in late clutches. Nestling reproductive value was also influenced by timing of reproduction: early clutches presented a lower ectoparasite load than late clutches. Finally, female investment in eggs was not related to nest ectoparasite load neither in early nor late clutches. With our results we conclude that spotless starling females invest more resources in early than in late clutches. However, future studies manipulating female condition, environmental variables and nestling reproductive value should be performed in order to test whether this seasonal decline in egg size and yolk androgens may have evolved as an adaptive female adjustment strategy.",maternal investment; seasonal adjustment; spotless starling; timing of reproduction; yolk androgens,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1472.pdf,December 2010,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/572/articles/321-332/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study was conducted in four beech and oak-dominated forests (Haut-Fays, Halma, Gembes and Croix-Scaille) located in the Ardennes Region of Southern Belgium. The study sites covered a total area of ca. 20 km<sup>2</sup>. A census of woodpecker occurrence (presence absence) was implemented from 2000 to 2003 within 255 1-ha plots. Habitat variables describing stand age, tree density, snag density, stand composition and vertical vegetation structure were also sampled at the same plots to develop both logistic and autologistic regression models describing habitat use. Middle spotted woodpecker (MSW) uses the oak-rich locations (mean basal area of 15.6 km<sup>2</sup>/ha), with selection of areas with the largest, oldest oak trees (mean circumference > 150 cm), and with a high diversity of tree species in the overstory. Similarly, the lesser spotted woodpecker (LSW) was detected in areas presenting the highest percentage cover of oak trees but with a selection of younger stands, with a high density of snags and dead wood (mean of 9 m<sup>3</sup>/ha). The integration of an autocorrelation term improved model performance for the LSW but not for MSW. Our results highlight the importance of a high disponibility of oak trees for these two sympatric species. The climax forest in northwest Europe is beech so that public and private owners must develop appropriate forest management plans to prevent the conversion of oak to beech forests. In particular, forest managers can promote an active oak regeneration management to obtain a balanced representation of age classes.

Investigation was carried out in three cultivated areas of Alentejo, Southern Portugal, presenting a dominance of cereal crops in open habitats. Foot transects were used to locate little bustards, during the autumn of 2001. Generalised Linear Models and Generalised Additive Models were performed to identify the species’ habitat preferences and to develop occurrence models, both at landscape and microhabitat scales. The results of the landscape analysis indicate that little bustards prefer cereal stubbles and fallow lands. Additionally, birds were mostly found in fields with more productive soils and close to water drainage lines. Microhabitat analysis shows that bustards occurred mainly in short grassy vegetation (around 10 cm), where the availability of green plants is higher. The results suggest that after the dry summer season, at the beginning of the agricultural year, food availability might still be limiting for the species. The implementation of agri-environmental schemes that promote the maintenance of stubbles and fallow land within areas with more productive soils are adequate measures to ensure foraging habitats for the little bustard.",autumn; green plants; fallow land; habitat preferences; little bustard; stubbles.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1475.pdf,December 2010,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/572/articles/363-373/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to investigate relationships between migration and other events in the annual cycle or environmental factors, we first need to acquire a basic knowledge of the dynamics (pattern and timing) of migration of various species. Our current knowledge of migration dynamics of European passerine birds is based mainly on studies of populations passing via the Western flyway. In contrast, relatively little is known about populations migrating via the Eastern flyway. We examined the seasonal pattern and timing of migration of several abundant passerine species flying across the eastern part of the Balkan Peninsula. We tested whether these were consistent between years within species and also among species within two ecological groups (long- and short-distance migrants). For most species the dynamics of migration were consistent between years. The pattern of migration was consistent among species of long- and of short-distance migrants.

CARRASCAL,,"This paper updates estimates of population size, distribution and habitat preferences of the endemic Canary Islands stonechat Saxicola dacotiae on the basis of data gathered across their whole distribution range, the island of Fuerteventura. We surveyed 1,462 0.5-km line transects during the reproductive seasons in 2005 and 2006, distributed across the whole island. Results were used to estimate population size using two methods: stratified estimates of mean densities and sum of estimated abundances across strata, and sum of estimations of abundance in 1 km x 1 km UTM squares based on statistical models built by boosted regression trees (BRT). In both methods we accounted for the effects of bird detectability in transects. Overall, 490 mature individuals were recorded. The Canary Islands stonechat preferred high, steep terrain (particularly above 20% slope and 200 m a. s. l.) and selected negatively the lower and flatter areas comprising most of the island. These habitats were occupied, however, albeit at low density. The highest average densities sampled per habitat (up to 43 birds/km<sup>2</sup>) were registered on steep areas (> 11%) with scrub, although the statistical models predicted densities of 66 birds/km<sup>2</sup> in the optimum sites (slopes higher than 22.5% with rocky ground). The population size of Canary Islands stonechat estimated with the stratified design was 20,504 individuals (CI 95%: 16,217-25,973), and the model based estimate (which we consider more reliable) was 14,436 (CI 95%: 13,376-15,492). These estimates are much higher than previous ones. We argue it is difficult to compare with Bibby and Hill’s (1987) results due to the different methodologies involved and areas covered by the monitoring programs, although we can not exclude an increase in population size during the last three decades. Discrepancies with García del Rey’s (2009) estimate appears to be due to an underestimate of the population size because of the lack of sampling in extensive areas and habitats of low bird density on the island.",boosted regression trees; distance sampling; Fuerteventura; habitat preferences; population size; Saxicola dacotiae,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1477.pdf,December 2010,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/572/articles/387-405/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GARCIA,,"An analysis of published transatlantic records of the blue-winged teal Anas discors and the greenwinged teal Anas carolinensis provides evidence that both species are regular migrants in small numbers to Europe and Africa and that they are not merely vagrants, as hitherto believed. Their occurrence is independent of the prevalence of westerly winds arising from variation in the North Atlantic Oscillation. Unlike transatlantic vagrants, annual record totals of both teals in Europe do not vary greatly between years. There is a high percentage of spring teal records, whereas most transatlantic vagrant species appear mainly in autumn. Each year the Nearctic teal records in Europe show a slow and predictable spread from north to south reflecting their migratory calendar in the Americas, with distinct spring and autumn peaks in northern areas and more winter records further south. As in the Americas, a higher proportion of green-winged teals occur further north and blue-winged teals are relatively more numerous in the south. The apparent lengths of stay of green-winged teals are longer in more southern areas, where the birds apparently winter, than further north, where they mainly occur on passage. This study suggests that the systematic recording and analysis of observations of rarities is worthwhile in order to reveal new migration patterns.",Anas carolinensis; Anas discors; blue-winged teal; green-winged teal; transatlantic migration; vagrancy; wintering,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1479.pdf,December 2010,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/572/articles/417-430/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To this end, 35 colonies of this species located in the NNW and SE of Sicily were monitored from 2003 to 2009. Counts of the active colonies and resident pairs were modelled by loglinear Poisson regressions to assess population trends over the study period. Afterwards, a GLM with an analysis of covariance design and a backward removal stepwise regression was performed to relate the observed trend to local- or global-scale climatic variation and to local land-use changes. Colony counts provided a better fit to the loglinear models than pair counts. Loglinear models separated the increasing trend of the SE population breeding in buildings and living in a flat semi-arid area from the non-increasing trend of the NNW population, which breeds on cliffs at higher altitudes and lives in a warm temperate area. The effect of the covariate ‘population’ suggests a considerable role for the geographic range in modelling the abundance of colonies, which appears to also be relevant when it interacts with climatic and land-use changes. Land-use variables have the greatest weight in predicting the abundance of lesser kestrel colonies. The transformation of arable land negatively correlates with the abundance of colonies in both areas, and the intensification of woody crop cultivation (vines, hops and orchards) is likely to be the major cause of the observed population trend in NNW Sicily. Warm, dry climatic conditionsin March and April, during the onset of reproduction, negatively affect lesser kestrels and the largescale climate significantly interacts with land uses. Conservation efforts aimed at the management of suitable habitat conditions of the SE population and the recovery of the NNW population must incorporate the effects of global warming in addition to land-use practices to allow for more effective actions to be taken.",climate change; Falco naumanni; land use; lesser kestrel; loglinear model; Mediterranean,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1487.pdf,December 2010,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/57especial/articles/3-22/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The DINDIS database results fromthemonitoring of bird communities occupying all areas affected by large wildfires in Catalonia since 2000. We used bird surveys conducted from 2006 to 2009 and performed a principal components analysis to describe two main gradients of variation in the composition of bird communities, which were used as descriptors of bird communities in subsequent analyses. We then analysed the relationships of these community descriptors with bioclimatic regions within Catalonia, time since fire and pre-fire vegetation (forest or shrubland). We have conducted 1,918 bird surveys in 567 transects distributed in 56 burnt areas. Eight out of the twenty most common detected species have an unfavourable conservation status, most of them being associated to open-habitats. Both bird communities’ descriptors had a strong regional component and were related to pre-fire vegetation, and to a lesser extent to the time since fire. We came to the conclusion that the responses of bird communities to wildfires are heterogeneous, complex and context dependent.

One of the most evident consequences of this situation is the great disparity in the protection level afforded to the species with different ecological needs, e. g. those linked to woodland vs. those living in open habitats, above all in farmland. The object of this paper is to stress the effectiveness of the Italian protected area network in the protection of bird species breeding in agricultural landscapes. Starting from a national open-habitat breeding bird list, using the data of the MITO 2000 project (Italian breeding birds monitoring project), we have built for each of them a national-scale ecological model, comparing the percentage of suitable habitat occurring inside and outside four different protected-area types (National Parks, Other Protected Areas, Natura 2000 sites and IBAs). Models were built using MaxEnt, a presence-only modelling method.

ORTIZ DE URBINA; Alba ESTRADA; Raimundo REAL; José C. BÁEZ,,"Seabird by-catch caused by longline fisheries is the most critical global threat to seabirds, mainly tubenose petrels. The Western Mediterranean is an important fishing area where the Spanish drifting longline operates. By-catch of these fisheries includes several resident and non-resident seabird species of different conservation concern. One of the main goals of seabird conservation is to disentangle the factors determining by-catch and to identify which management and conservation actions are necessary to mitigate this problem. In this paper, we modeled the effects of surface longline and its interaction with others fisheries on seabird by-catch. We used data recorded by onboard observers of the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO) within the monitoring program for commercial longline fisheries from 2000 to 2009. We estimated a favourability function from logistic regression where the dependent variable was the presence or absence of seabird by-catch per set and the independent variables were those related to technical characteristics of the fishery, interactions with other fisheries, geographical location, and month. The interaction with other fisheries was estimated as the number of working and non-working days (weekend and official holidays), because the Spanish fishing legislation only allows longliners to operate in non-working days. We obtained a statistically significant favourability model with the following variables: traditional longline targeting swordfish, longline targeting albacore, number of hooks, latitude where the setting started, fisheries over continental shelf, October, and non-working days. The difference of the favourability function between working and non-working days provided a measure of the effect of non-working days on seabird by-catch. We concluded that the effects of the interaction with others fisheries on seabird by-catch are important, making non working days 48% more favourable than working days for increase seabird by-catch.

A large dataset of steppe bird occurrence was collected through a combined stratified random field sampling design. The species-habitat associations were quantified using a non-linear regression approach (MARS) within a robust methodological framework. The methodology showed consistent results with what is known, confirming most of the existing knowledge on habitat use by the local steppe bird community, while adding further information. The approach is thus reliable and could potentially be used to investigate less well known communities.

Great tits in noisier locations sang with a higher minimum frequency and narrower bandwidth than in quieter locations. None of the other song components measured (maximum frequency, peak frequency per note or strophe length) covaried with noise levels. An increase in minimum frequency in the song of the great tit is expected to facilitate detection and song perception by conspecifics over the strong levels of low-frequency urban noise. Such song plasticity may be one of the characteristics that allows this species to be a successful urban coloniser.

In this study we adapted the indices proposed by Garthe and Hüpop (2004) for offshore wind farms to a terrestrial wind farm as a method to identify more sensitive raptors and to detect high vulnerability areas for wind farms. We constructed two indices: a raptor sensitivity index (RSI) and a spatial vulnerability index (SVI). The RSI included seven factors derived from the attributes of species that have been considered important in assessing the impact of wind farms on birds. Using an RSI and relative habitat use estimation, an SVI was calculated and a potential vulnerability map was produced for Boquerón mountain range in Valencia region. Golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos, shorttoed eagle Circaetus gallicus and booted eagle Hieraaetus pennatus, together with other species such as griffon vulture Gyps fulvus were the more sensitive species to wind farm.

Habitat variables of territories and random points were measured in the field on a 25 m radius and from GIS layers on scales of 25 m, 100 m, 500 m and 1,000 m radius. Habitat variables were analysed by a generalized linear model. The ortolan bunting was found on a 25 m radius in areas with a few black pines, with low grass and open patches within the herbaceous layer. On a 100 m radius scale, the probability of occurrence was highest in areas with meadows with large trees, permanent and partly overgrown meadows, and small areas of forests. On a 500 m radius scale, the occurrence of the ortolan bunting was negatively affected by urban areas and their infrastructure and by forests, and positively by partly overgrown meadows and permanent meadows with or without large trees. On a 1,000 m radius, permanent meadows with or without large trees, and the absence of large urban areas and infrastructure positively affected the presence of the ortolan bunting. In conclusion, factors influencing habitat selection by the ortolan bunting differ according to spatial scale. On the territorial level, its presence was only influenced by cover of open and partly overgrown meadows and by forest, while on larger scales it was also affected by the cover of urban areas. Factors influence habitat selection differently on different scales; a forest influences the probability of a territory positively on a small scale while negatively on larger scales. Factors influencing the habitat selection positively on a larger scale are becoming less common and therefore fewer suitable sites are available for the ortolan bunting in Kras.",anthropogenic disturbance; conservation; Emberiza hortulana; Emberizidae; habitat selection; multi-scale habitat association; ortolan bunting; succession,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1451.pdf,June 2010,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/571/articles/55-68/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our aim was to study the stopover of bluethroats Luscinia svecica cyanecula in northern Iberia. Data were collected at Badina de Escudera lagoon (reedbeds), Villafranca (42º 16'N 01º 42'W), Ebro Valley. Systematic mist-netting was performed during the autumn migration period between 2003 and 2006. The timing of passage did not vary between age and sex classes, with the bulk of migrants being captured in September. The stopover duration was very long (nearly 30 days) compared to that reported from other stopover sites. Main causes explaining these results could be: (i) an atypical September with unfavourable meteorological conditions, and (ii) the interference of apparently wintering specimens. Apart from a small fraction of birds with very large fuel loads, a mean fuel load of nearly 15 % over lean mass suggests that, if a fraction of migrants stopping-over in Badina overwinter in tropical Africa, they must refuel in areas further south to gain sufficient fuel before crossing the Sahara. Conversely, we cannot rule out that these less loaded birds overwintered within the circum-Mediterranean region. Adults were more fuel loaded than juveniles, but this was not due to a higher fuel deposition rate (mean 0.08 g/day). Bluethroats recaptured from 6 to 10 days after the first capture showed a higher mass deposition rate than those recaptured after 10 days or more. This suggests that birds with long stopovers were not true fuelling migrants, but more probably wintering specimens with balanced energy budgets. A long initial lost of mass (5 days) agrees with both the high competition and the interference of wintering specimens hypotheses. In conclusion, Badina de Escudera, in northern Iberia, is an area used by a true, stopping-over population, as well as by apparently wintering specimens.",age; bluethroat; fuel deposition rate; fuel load; Luscinia svecica cyanecula; migration; northern Iberia; stopover duration,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1452.pdf,June 2010,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/571/articles/69-85/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper examines the seasonal bird use of crop types in one of such agro-ecosystem the Huerta of Valencia (Spain). Three hundred and seventy nine cultivated fields were censused on a monthly basis from June 2002 to May 2003, and the patterns of bird species richness and crop type selection were examined through Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and resource selection functions. Sixty-nine species were recorded, reaching maximum values of species richness and bird abundance during winter. The bird assemblage was much skewed with six species accounting for 70 % of the birds recorded. Results indicated that high species richness was associated with fallow fields and orange groves with weeds, but this result was partially dependent on seasons and management. Conversely, most row crops were hardly used by birds. Although no data on bird populations inhabiting the Huerta before agricultural intensification processes exists, data suggests an impoverishment of bird fauna in the last decades mainly through the removal of non-crop habitats. However, the main threat to bird fauna is currently land transformation of the Huerta for urban or industrial purposes. Conservation of this agroecosystem and of its rich cultural heritage will need agri-environmental programs along with proper landscape planning policies.",agricultural intensification; cropland; habitat selection; Huerta; landscape planning; orange groves; Valencia,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1453.pdf,June 2010,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/571/articles/87-102/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analysed foraging effort as capture rate (i. e. number of prey eaten per minute) and capture success (i. e. number of successful dives per total dives made); and foraging efficiency as the number of captured prey per foraging time, the total biomass consumed and the energy intake obtained per time. We expected a piscivorous diet, but the most frequent prey were crabs, represented by Cyrtograpsus angulatus and Neohelice granulate, followed by diverse fish species. Diving time for different prey types and foraging sites did not differ. Handling time was higher for crabs. Foraging effort and foraging efficiency were higher for grebes that preyed on crabs, but in terms of biomass and energy return no differences were found, not even between sites.

In this study we investigated the distribution of nectar feeding behaviour at Mediterranean stopover sites in spring, checking 10 species for the presence of pollen on plumage during ringing activities carried out at 14 stopover sites placed in Spain, Italy and Greece. Moreover we investigated the possible relationship between nectar consumption by migrants and vegetation at three stopover sites, through the time budget analysis of 8 species during no-flight activities. Sylvia and Phylloscopus species were often found to use nectar, the former more frequently than the latter. However, nectar exploitation results usual only at 2 Mediterranean sites out of 14, Ventotene and Antikythira (Greece), while it seems to be common at African stopover sites. The analysis of time budget and the pattern of nectar feeding distribution at stopover sites suggests that in the Mediterranean region nectar consumption is most likely related to the youngest phases of vegetation, these possibly being richer in flowering plants potentially usable by songbirds.",diet; habitat use; nectar; Phylloscopus; stopover; Sylvia; time-budget,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1458.pdf,June 2010,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/571/articles/143-157/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, this advantage could be reflected in energetic costs (thermal stress, hyperthermia) in the case of species where the breeding season is prolonged during several months, particularly in hot regions such as the Mediterranean basin. In this study we examined the existing differences between woodcrete and wooden nest boxes with regard to the microclimate of the nest and the reproductive parameters of the tree sparrow, a multi-nesting species (three clutches from April until the beginning of August). Larger clutches and chicks with a smaller body mass were found in the woodcrete nests, this latter probably due to a greater transpiration rate to counteract higher temperatures. Nevertheless, there was no difference between breeding success between box types. The results suggest that, considering a full breeding season, the virtues of woodcrete nest boxes outweigh the inconveniences and account for its great acceptance in the colony.",,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1459.pdf,June 2010,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/571/articles/159-166/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The work was conducted in the National Pine Forest of Leiria, a highly organised production forest, essentially consisting of maritime pine, Pinus pinaster, and located in the central west coast of Portugal (39º 50` N, 8º 57` W, 30 - 50 m a. s. l.). The SP irrupted in a homogeneous area consisting of young pines. Bird abundances and richness were estimated by point counts in the infested area and in two similar non-infested areas. The counts were made during all four seasons, covering all stages of the moth annual cycle and were repeated during two years. The overall abundance of birds was similar in both infested and non-infested areas. However, the richness of canopy gleaners was higher in the SP area than in a nearby non-infested area. Only two bird species responded numerically to the increased insect abundance: the blackbird Turdus merula, and the great tit Parus major. Thus the passerine community responded only to a limited degree to the irruption of the SP. Three factors might have accounted for the results: (i) the bird community consists mostly of territorial residents or short distance migrants and their low range of dispersal may decrease the probability of a response to a localized insect outbreak. (ii) The larvae of the pine processionary moth has urticating hairs which are considered to be an effective repellent defence against vertebrate predators, thus reducing the number of species that could react to the high caterpillar densities. (iii) The simple vegetation structure of the forest, homogeneous stands of small young trees, precludes the establishment of cavity nesters that constitute a large part of the canopy gleaners and most of the species which have been reported as potential T. pityocampa predators. However, results indicate that this important Mediterranean defoliator may have a positive effect on the canopy gleaners and on some species that are able to act as its predators.",bird community; insect defoliator; insect outbreak; life-cycle shift; Mediterranean pine forest; numerical response; point count,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1435.pdf,December 2009,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/562/articles/189-203/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Crop contents were identified and classified with a binocular magnifying glass, dried and weighed. Quadratic and linear regression analyses were fitted to the standardized data of the dry weight of each food type in order to assess seasonal trends of the diet elements. The results shows that greenfinch nestlings were mainly fed on seeds, leaves and bulbs, of which Erodium cicutarium seeds were the most consumed type food. Seeds of this seed-bearing plant were found in the nestlings' crops throughout the whole breeding season, but consumption decreased as the breeding season progressed. However, the consumption of bulbs, another common food type, increased. Aphids appeared in the crops at the beginning of the season but contributed little to the diet of the chicks.

The mean laying date (LD, mean 30 April) correlated positively with latitude, with a delay of 6 days for every 10 ºN. The mean clutch size (CS, mean 4.95 ± 0.26) increased significantly with latitude and was affected by nest-type (nest-box vs natural nests). The mean number of fledglings showed no correlation. Tenerife populations nesting below 1,000 m. a. s. l. showed the earliest LD in the Western Palearctic while those nesting above 1,000 m. a. s. l. showed a similar nesting pattern to European populations, although the CS is lower. The latitudinal variation in LD and CS coincides with the classical postulates (delay and increase respectively, towards the North) but does not explain the variations presented here. In agreement with recent studies, nest-type (nest-box vs natural nests) and climatic factors such as temperature (winter, spring) and spring rainfall influence latitudinal variations.

PAIS; Juan A. FARGALLO; Jaime POTTI; Jesús A. LEMUS; José A. DÁVILA,,"Isolated bird populations on oceanic islands may be good study models for the investigation of the interrelationships between social fractions of populations, especially due to their lack of long-range dispersal as a major mechanism influencing the dynamics and persistence of populations. We examined whether the ratio of breeders to non-breeders varies in a completely isolated red-billed chough (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax) population on an oceanic island (La Palma, Canary Islands) as compared to continental and other island populations, and assessed whether limited breeding opportunities may influence population crowding with non-breeding birds. The chough population in La Palma was composed of a proportion of non-breeders (about 60 %) representing twice the values reported in other populations. Most communal roosts were used during the breeding season by floaters sufficient in numbers to replace any loss among breeders. The average number of pairs nesting at several roosts did not differ between consecutive years despite much higher numbers of floaters using these sites throughout the year. The high proportion of non-breeding choughs suggests that nesting areas were saturated with non-breeding floaters due to some kind of limitation on breeding opportunities. Under conditions of isolation, limited breeding opportunities of floaters can not be eased by dispersing to other nuclei or vacant geographical areas outside the island, leading to a crowded non-breeding fraction. The dense chough population mostly composed of gregarious floaters in La Palma may be considered a guarantee of persistence and even future numerical increase. However, a low contribution of floaters to the effective population size compared with their contribution to the total population density may enhave repercussions in conservation by reducing the availability of essential resources for breeding pairs, which requires further research.",aislamiento poblacional; dispersión; individuos flotantes; islas Canarias; La Palma; Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1438.pdf,December 2009,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/562/articles/229-239/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PALOMARES; José Antonio MARTÍNEZ,,"The moult sequence of sparrowhawks in Spain and its variations regarding the previously described pattern, and how to use it for on-hand age determination of individuals is described. Eighteen adult sparrowhawks were trapped during the breeding seasons between 2001 and 2007 in Vizcaya and 129 sparrowhawks were examined in Wildlife Rehabilitation Centres between 1999 and 2007, including individuals from Vizcaya and Alava (Northern Spain), Madrid, Guadalajara, Salamanca and Toledo (Central Spain), and Granada and Jaén (Southern Spain). A total of 147 full-grown sparrowhawks were analysed in order to determine the moult sequence. The moult in primaries and their respective primary coverts went in order from the innermost (P1) to the outermost (P10). The moult of secondaries started in four separate moult foci, S5 being normally the first to be shed; afterwards the second focus was located in S11, the third was located in S1 and the fourth in S13. The moult of rectrices usually started in the central pair followed by R4 and R6, while R5 and specially R2 were the last tail feathers moulted. The moult started in June and finished in November. 18.75 % of breeding females and 55.5 % of breeding males had arrested the moult. None of the breeding birds retained flight feathers from the previous season, whilst 32 % of the wintering females and 30 % of wintering males presented retained feathers. Sparrowhawks in Spain follow closely the pattern described by Newton and Marquiss (1982) for Scottish sparrowhawks. However, the effect of wintering birds on the sedentary population and other variables provoke some differences with regard to the Scottish model. These data can be used as a tool to determine the age of Spanish sparrowhawks and could be hypothetically used to distinguish wintering birds from local populations.",age; Eurasian sparrowhawk; incomplete moult; moult; sequence,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1439.pdf,December 2009,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/562/articles/241-251/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Benefits of early breeding are important in terms of reproductive output. Costs are mainly associated to weather adversities at early stages of the breeding season.

We studied the potential association between the prevalence of infection by Haemoproteus, condition and age with the breeding phenology in male pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca in a montane population in central Spain.

RODRÍGUEZ-GIRONÉS; Andrés BARBOSA,,"Carotenoids have moderate ionization energies and very high and positive electron affinities. In other words: carotenoids are more likely to induce oxidation than to prevent it. This result is in stark contrast with the common assumption that carotenoids are good antioxidants, an assumption going back to 1932 that has been subject to scant critical scrutiny. Numerous studies, from medicine to behavioural ecology, show that birds benefit from a diet rich in carotenoids. One of their hypothesized beneficial properties is that carotenoids contribute to fight oxidative stress. Among behavioural ecologists, this hypothesis has led to the proposal that carotenoids are the handicap that stabilizes the evolutionary trajectories of many sexual displays: if carotenoids are required to fight oxidative stress, only high-quality individuals will be able to divert them from metabolic pathways to colourful ornaments. But this explanation is currently under siege: a number of recent studies in birds have found little correlation between carotenoid concentrations in tissues and their total antioxidant ability. Our results suggest that the current paradigm needs a thorough revision. It is unlikely that carotenoids prevent the oxidation of molecular machinery, but they can nevertheless act as scavengers of free radicals. In particular, they will readily neutralize free electrons that escape from the mitochondrial electron-transport chains. Testing this possibility will require new experimental approaches: carotenoid concentration should correlate with the ability of tissues to absorb free electrons (i. e. to prevent reduction), but not with its antioxidant potential.",carotenoids; electron transfer; oxidative stress; sexual selection,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1444.pdf,December 2009,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/562/articles/287-294/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(ii) Analysis of the main environmental factors probably affecting the breeding success in the population studied. (iii) Comparison of results obtained from published studies, carried out in most probably secondary and more stable types of habitats. Location: The ""Ujscie Warty"" National Park, Western Poland. Methods: The study was carried out during six breeding seasons in years 2000 - 2005. The size of the breeding population was estimated on the basis of nests found in the study area. When climbing the tree was possible, nests were inspected directly. Inaccessible nests were checked by means of a mirror attached to an aluminium tube. The data came from 1,204 inspections of 235 nests. The complete data, from egg laying up to fledging or failure, were obtained for 211 nests. Results: The population was characterised by a relatively high density of breeding pairs (2.6 - 3.8 pairs/km<sup>2</sup>), small mean clutch size (4.34) as well as moderate mean (50.2 %) and changeable (24.5 % - 84.4 %) breeding success throughout the years. Furthermore, the breeding success was positively affected by water conditions as well as mean daily air temperature and negatively by mean daily precipitation. Moreover, the mean number of fledglings per each inspected nest (1.48) was low, whereas the mean number of offspring per successful nest (2.95) was relatively high in comparison with other studied crow populations. Conclusions: In the flooded lowland river valley during the breeding seasons, two periods were distinguished: the first period, the time of egg formation and their laying, when hydrological conditions were unfavourable but relatively stable in comparison to other breeding habitats of the hooded crow and do not differ between seasons; the second period, the time during which nestlings stay in the nests, which is characterised by variable water conditions. This determined the scale of breeding success and the relatively big differences in the overall breeding output between years. As a result of most probably primary biotope and relatively unfavourable conditions for breeding, the population studied is characterised by high breeding density but small clutch size and low breeding success in comparison with other populations studied.",breeding success; clutch size; Corvus cornix; hooded crow; water level; weather; wetlands.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1417.pdf,June 2009,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/561/articles/13-24/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Location: Forests in the eastern part of São Miguel Island, Azores. Methods: Point-counts were conducted in two exotic forest habitats (copses of Pittosporum undulatum and plantations of Cryptomeria japonica) and in the native laurel forest. Program DISTANCE was used to estimate ecological densities (birds/ha) for five bird species per forest type. Mist-netting was carried out to assess the relative abundance of birds in four plots representing different altitudes and a gradient of infestation by exotic plants. Results: Nine bird species were recorded during the point-counts, and six of them occurred in the three forest types. Goldcrest Regulus regulus azoricus was the most generalist and abundant species in all forest types and the endemic Azores bullfinch Pyrrhula murina the most specialist, occurring only in native forest. Both point counts and mist-netting showed higher diversity and equitability in areas/plots with native forest, although species richness was not higher than in exotic forests. Mist-netting results showed highest diversity and equitability in the mid-altitude native forest plot. Conclusions: Birds showed a higher relative abundance in native than in exotic forests. Goldcrest was the most abundant species in C. japonica forest whereas the distribution of the Azores bullfinch was heavily restricted by the spread of exotic forest.

Accordingly, factors compromising fuel deposition rate, such as parasite infections, might have relevant effects not only on migration, but also on other life history events that depend on migration success, such as breeding. We analysed the effect of haemosporidians on fuel load and fuel deposition rate in a population of migratory blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) during stopover in northern Iberia. Locality: Loza lagoon, northern Iberia (42º 50'N, 01º 43'W, 400 m a. s. l.). Methods: From blood samples of recaptured blackcaps we determined haemospiridian content by amplification of 479 bp of the parasite's cytochrome b gene. Independent on body size, of the sampled birds, 35 % were infected by Haemoproteus-Plasmodium. Results: Mass deposition rate, fat score and body mass showed similar values in non-infected as in infected blackcaps. No differences in age or body size proportions were detected between infected and non-infected birds. Conclusions: These results may be explained by infected birds with high virulence (compromising fuel accumulation) being unable to migrate south from their breeding areas in central and northern Europe. In contrast, more resistant birds may be able to tolerate the parasitaemia and gain fuel normally. Another possibility is that only birds with a low intensity of parasite infection were captured (presumably birds able to overcome the parasitaemia successfully), since these birds may be able to accumulate fuel at a similar rate to non-infected birds. Furthermore, highly infected birds may have a lower likelihood of capture than non-infected birds, because birds lose mobility with a high intensity of infection and under these circumstances they are less likely to be captured.",blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla); fuel load; fuel deposition rate; haemosporidians; migration; parasites.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1419.pdf,June 2009,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/561/articles/41-47/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HELENO,,"Aims: Ferns are an important component of many ecosystems and potentially provide an abundant food resource for consumers, but there are very few studies on the ecology of fern feeding by vertebrates. We describe the selection of sporangia and leaves among fern species by the Azores bullfinch (Pyrrhula murina), and addressed the importance of nutritional composition in fern choice. Location: Serra da Tronqueira (37º 47'N, 25º 13'W), a mountainous district on the east of SÁ£o Miguel Island, Azores. Methods: We established transects throughout the range of the Azores bullfinch to record: i) the abundance of sporangia (= number of fertile leaves), and of each leaf phenological stage (crozier, expanding leaves and recently expanded leaves) for each fern species, and ii) fern consumption, as the number of leaves with beak marks (fern stripping) for each fern species. The composition of both mature sporangia and young fern leaves (lipids, proteins, phenolics and caloric content) was compared between consumed and non-consumed fern species. Results: In winter and early spring the Azores bullfinch foraged on sporangia of Woodwardia radicans, Culcita macrocarpa and Pteris incompleta, and in spring/early summer, it took leaves of Osmunda regalis and Pteridium aquilinum and sporangia of O. regalis. From the three leaf phenological stages, expanding leaves and recently expanded leaves were preferred over croziers. The spores of consumed fernspecies were significantly higher in lipids than leaves of consumed species, but leaves had a higher content in protein and phenolics than spores. The lipid content of spores was nearly significantly different between consumed and non-consumed species, but the nutritional composition of leaves was similar between consumed and non consumed fern species. Conclusions: The Azores bullfinch was selective when foraging on fern sporangia and leaves. Fern species with sporangia of higher lipid content appeared to be preferred. When compared to seeds, fern sporangia possess similar caloric content and, therefore, should be an important source of energy during the winter. The consumption of leaves in early spring, possessing high amounts of proteins and reasonable high values of calories, may enable birds to survive until other foods became available. This study suggests that overall energy may be the most limiting factor for the Azores bullfinch when selecting foraging fern species in winter.",Azores bullfinch; fern feeding; fern nutritional composition; food preference.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1422.pdf,June 2009,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/561/articles/71-84/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Blood, feathers or tissues samples from 99 individuals were used for extracting DNA to taxonomically classified two subspecies of reed buntings. Biometric measures were compared between E. s. schoeniclus and E. s. witherbyi subspecies for the 43 individuals for which subspecies assignation was known by molecular analysis. Discriminant analyses were used to identify the best traits for discriminating between the two subspecies. Biometric measurements from another different 105 reed buntings were externally used to validate the discriminant function.

Ardeola,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/,2008,,Volume 55(2),,Copulation duration during courtship predicts fertility in the eurasian kestrel Falco tinnunculus,,Pablo VERGARA; Juan Antonio FARGALLO,,"Aims: Mechanisms that reduce cuckoldry such as frequent or long copulations are adaptive for males. However, these behaviours are costly and their intensity should therefore be adjusted to the risk of extra pair copulation (EPC) as perceived by males. In addition, it has been proposed that high quality males perceive a lower risk of EPC than low quality males, and consequently show low paternity assurance responses. This hypothesis was tested in the eurasian kestrel by studying the relationship between copulation frequency and duration, and variables that are considered indexes of quality in this species (e. g. clutch size). Location: Campo Azálvaro region (central Spain). Methods: Nests were monitored during the pre-laying period to record copulation frequency (presence or absence) and duration. Results: It was found that males having larger clutches showed shorter copulas. In addition, no relationships were found between copulation frequency and any of the studied indexes of male quality. As far as is known, this is the first case in which copulation behaviour co-varies negatively with an index of male quality in terms of breeding performance. Conclusions: It is suggested that females mating with high quality males do not seek EPCs, which reduce the risk of extra-pair paternity perceived by these males.",agonistic behaviour; copulation frequency; extra-pair copulation; extra-pair paternity; mate guarding; paternity assurance,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1402.pdf,December 2008,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/552/articles/153-160/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this paper is to compare the bill morphology of crossbills inhabiting mountain (Pinus uncinata) and black pine (P. nigra) forests within the same geographical area in the Mediterranean where there is a high diversity of native pine species. We predicted that the large spines and thick apophyses of the mountain pine should favour crossbills with larger and more massive beaks. Location: Mountain pine crossbill populations were sampled at 6 localities within the Port del Comte mountain (SolsonÁ¨s, Lleida) and Lles areas (Cerdanya, Lleida). Black pine crossbill populations were trapped at 8 localities located between the Oliana and the Busa mountain ranges (SolsonÁ¨s) and Castelltallat mountains (Bages, Barcelona). Methods: Measurements of head length, bill length, depth and width, and the distance between the tips of the lower and upper mandibles, from a sample of 1,152 birds captured at mountain pine populations and 132 at black pine populations. Results: Crossbills inhabiting mountain pine areas showed more massive bills and greater bill depths than those inhabiting black pine areas. The difference found in the bill depths approached 0.2 mm, which is similar to the differences between reproductively isolated call types of crossbills in other areas in Central Europe and North America. An index of bill depth / bill length also provided very significant differences between birds of different habitats. Conclusions: Results support the hypothesis that crossbills have adapted locally to the cones of these two pine species or, alternatively, that such differences have arisen from differential dispersal whereby individuals sort between habitats based on their bill sizes.",local divergence; Loxia curvirostra; Mediterraenan; Pinus uncinata; Pinus nigra; bill morphology,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1404.pdf,December 2008,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/552/articles/169-177/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An Iberian perspective",,Eduardo DE JUANA,,"Aims: The occurrence patterns of these Siberian passerines in the western Palearctic are examined in order to test the different hypotheses regarding their causes. In particular, it is attempted to check whether the geographical distribution of records may be biased by an uneven distribution of potential observers. Location: Europe, with particular reference to the Iberian Peninsula and the Atlantic islands of Spain and Portugal. Methods: The distribution of records by countries is compared with that of the ringing effort currently employed in each. Occurrence patterns are also analysed both by dates and by the locations in which records tend to be concentrated in each country. Results: Differences between countries in numbers of records are much greater than differences in the distribution of potential observers. On the other hand, autumn arrivals are much earlier on average in Scandinavia and the British Isles than on the Atlantic coasts of central Europe, in the Iberian peninsula or in other Mediterranean areas, where there are also much higher percentages of winter and spring records. Conclusions: The scarcity of records of these species in southwest Europe can not be accounted for by a low density of potential observers. This, coupled with the differences existing in the mean arrival dates, suggests that just a small fraction of the birds visiting Scandinavia and the British Isles during the autumn move later on through the Iberian Peninsula. On the other hand, the minimal incidence of these species during the spring in the whole of Europe suggests that just a small part of the autumn population spends the winter in Africa. Taking all this into account, a new hypothesis is put forward: that these birds arriving at Europe are mainly juveniles on exploratory migration (Zwischenzug) and that later in the autumn they travel back to Asia directly from northwestern Europe.",Asia; Canary Islands; Europe; exploratory migration; Iberian Peninsula; migration theories; reverse migration; ringing effort; Pallas's warbler; yellow-browed warbler,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1405.pdf,December 2008,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/552/articles/179-192/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

D´AMICO; Marcelo N. BERTELLOTTI; Allan J. BAKER; Wallace R. TELLINO JUNIOR; Patricia M. GONZÁLEZ,,"Aims: To test whether different migratory strategies in red knots (Calidris canutus rufa) are a response to spatial variation in parasite pressure at different marine wintering sites as predicted by the´parasite' hypothesis of Piersma (1997). Location: Río Grande and Tierra del Fuego, Argentina; Maranhão, Brazil; Delaware Bay, USA. Methods: The abundance of ectoparasites and blood parasites and the frequency of parasitized birds were estimated at the three sites. Ectoparasites were scored visually and parasites in blood were searched for with molecular assays and observations of smears on slides. Birds caught in mixed flocks refueling in Delaware Bay were assigned to either northern (Maranhão or possibly Florida) or southern wintering sites (Tierra del Fuego) using stable isotopes in feathers. Results: All ectoparasites found were feather lice were Mallophaga, Phthiraptera. The 4.4 % of birds in Tierra del Fuego and the 100 % in Maranhão had ectoparasites. In Delaware Bay the proportion of parasitized birds from northern and southern sites was not significantly different. No blood parasites (Plasmodium spp., Haemoproteus spp. and Leucocytozoon spp.) were found in the samples. Conclusions: Only 4.4 % of birds wintering in Tierra del Fuego had ectoparasites whereas all birds wintering in Maranhão were parasitized, often heavily. During migration through Delaware Bay in May, the proportion of parasitized birds from northern (50 %) and southern (40.1 %) sites was not significantly different, indicating that many southern birds had been infected during a short stopover on the northwards migration or by direct contact in Delaware Bay. The parasite hypothesis predicts that red knots should evolve migrations to low-parasite marine wintering sites to reduce the fitness consequences of high ectoparasite load in tropical Maranhão, but there is likely to be a tradeoff with increased mortality for long-distance migration to cold-temperate Tierra del Fuego. All blood parasite assays were negative for Plasmodium spp., Haemoproteus spp. and Leucocytozoon spp, consistent with the low incidence of blood parasite vectors in marine shores. Observations in each wintering site support a role for parasite pressure in the evolution of migration strategies in red knots. However, it will be very important to extend studies to birds captured at Delaware Bay since results could suggest that southern populations would have detrimental effects of longer migratory distances and ectoparasites load, whereas northern populations only would suffer the negative effects of the parasite load. The results open the way for similar tests of the parasite hypothesis on other pathogens and endoparasites.",red knots; wintering sites; ectoparasites; blood parasite,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1406.pdf,December 2008,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/552/articles/193-202/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This makes them a key habitat for bird conservation. However, they are being negatively affected by conversion to tree plantations, urban developments and infrastructures. Location: Bird communities in 67 farmland patches which were immersed in a matrix of shrublands and woodlands were studied. These were distributed along a 600 km-long stretch that runs parallel to the northern Spanish coast. Methods: During June (2005) and January (2006) evaluation was carried out on the effect of farmland patch size, vegetation structure, elevation (a surrogate of climate harshness) and geographical location of farmlands on bird richness and abundance by means of 500 m long transects. Results: Farmland patches with abundant tree and shrub cover scored the highest on abundance and species richness in spring. The size of farmland patch predicted the occurrence of many species in spring and winter, including some that are declining in Europe (e. g. Lanius collurio, Passer montanus, Miliaria calandra, Alauda arvensis, etc.). In winter, bird abundance increased at low elevation areas and decreased with increasing distance from the main gateway for European migrants entering the Iberian Peninsula at the western Pyrenees. Conclusions: Results support the idea that easternmost farmlands are particularly important wintering grounds for European migrants and that the increasing deterioration or reduction of lowland farmland patches may affect bird populations. Because such negative effects are likely to increase in the near future, some general guidelines are suggested to apply the legal and budgetary resources of the European Union for better preserving farmland biodiversity in northern Spain.",biodiversity; Common Agricultural Policy (CAP); land-use change,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1407.pdf,December 2008,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/552/articles/203-219/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patches selected are representative of the main forest ecosystems in the area: mixed deciduous and chestnut woodland. The study was conducted in Caurel (Galicia, NW Spain), a mountain area that is under a swift process of land abandonment. Land use changes were assessed by means of the 1978 and 2006 vegetation maps. Changes in the avifauna at the landscape level were assessed by comparing two intensive bird surveys conducted in 1977 and 2000. Bird assemblages in the two woodland patches were censused using exactly the same transects in 1977, 1999 and 2004. The largest percent change in vegetation was evident in total woodland area (+34 %). Changes in bird populations at the landscape level were consistent with changes in vegetation, thus favouring woodland/high scrub species. However, local bird assemblages in the woodland patches appeared to remain stable in species richness, composition and structure throughout the 27 years of the study. We suggest that the little long-term variability exhibited by these bird assemblages could be related to habitat stability in the woodland patches.",,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1408.pdf,December 2008,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/552/articles/221-227/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Location: Villalba, Madrid, Spain. Methods: 18 microsatellite primers isolated from 7 different bird species were used as starting point. Their Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was optimized. The polymorphism and genetic variability of primers that produced bands of expected size and had a clear electropherogram and segregation pattern was checked. To test the real suitability of these primers in genetic studies, they were used to analyze the frequency of extra-pair paternity (EPP), intra-specific brood parasitism (IBP) and pseudo-parasitism in 30 breeding pairs and 206 offspring. Results: Six of the 18 initial primers were selected by their polymorphism (average alleles per locus: 8), heterozygosity (expected heterozygosity: 0.656), segregation and unambiguous electropherogram pattern.

Results and Conclusions: The world population is estimated to be between 43,500 and 51,200 individuals, of which ca. 60 % occur in Spain. The results suggest that total numbers have not decreased during the last decade, in contrast to the declining trend currently assumed. This is largely due to the overall positive tendency recently observed in the Iberian Peninsula. Some small central European populations that had been decreasing for several decades are also recovering now, apparently due to active conservation measures. However, a reduction in range is still occurring, with a tendency to concentrate at sites with high-quality habitat.

Location: NE Spain. Methods: Bird presence data were obtained from the Atlas of Spanish Breeding Birds and forest landscape variables were extracted from the Spanish Forest Map developed within the Third Spanish National Forest Inventory. The analyses were carried out through multiple linear regressions and considering multicollinearity and spatial autocorrelation problems. Results: Forest landscape characteristics influenced more on specialist than on generalist bird species richness, explaining 62 % and 52 % of total variation, respectively. Forest area was the most important landscape factor, although bird species richness was also considerably favoured by tree species diversity and by the abundance of coniferous forest. Forests with too closed canopy cover (equal or bigger than 80 %) supported less bird species. The effects of forest landscape configuration were weak compared to composition; the only significant configuration index was the mean circumscribing circle index, as a potential indicator of the naturalness of forest landscapes. Conclusions: Forest landscape management should focus on forest habitat availability and forest structure features rather than on a particular forest landscape configuration, promoting an amalgam of forest tree species and avoiding an excessively closed canopy. However, and especially for generalists, it is necessary to consider the characteristics of other non-forest land cover types for an adequate management and conservation of forest bird communities.",forest birds; forest configuration and composition; forest landscape management; Mediterranean basin; shape irregularity,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1362.pdf,June 2008,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/551/articles/27-40/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results: Body measurements in males were significantly larger than in females. Within each pair, males had larger head length, bill depth, long bill length and body mass. Discriminant analysis indicated than the combination of three measurements (head length, bill depth and wing length) predicted correctly the sex of 98.5 % of individuals. Conclusions: The discriminant function described by Bosch (1996) cannot be used to identify sex properly in Atlantic Iberian yellow-legged gulls because they are significantly smaller than their Mediterranean counterparts. No significant differences were found with yellow-legged gull populations from Western extreme of Cantabrian coast (Galicia).

GIL-DELGADO; Daniel GUIJARRO,,"Aims: Sampling diet of passerine nestlings can be associated with bias and danger to the birds, according the methods adopted, but an understanding of diet is essential to development of conservation measures. This paper describes a new technique for examining the diet of cardueline finches that store food in gullet pouches prior to digestion. We applied this method to nestlings of goldfinches Carduelis carduelis of 31 nests. Goldfinch nestlings were selected because the diet of their chicks is poorly known. Location: Our study was conducted near Sagunto in eastern Spain (39º 42' N, 0º 15' W). The area was located within extensive orange monocultures that are widely spraying in the east of Spain. Methods: A small spoon was used to obtain the food directly from the gullets. Samples were obtained from 3 - 10 day old nestlings and samples from nestlings in the same nest were combined. Animal prey seeds were separated. Seeds of the same species were put together. We dried each sample at 103 ºC for two hours to assess dry weight. After drying, each food type from a nest was weighed. In order to test the method effect on the nestlings we compared the breeding success between the sampled nests and another 31 nests that were not manipulated and hatching close to the sampled nests. Results: Thistles of two species, Sonchus oleraceus and Carduus pycnocephalus were the main food and the contributions to the diet varied across the breeding season. The two species of thistles showed opposite trends. The contribution of animal foods in the diet decreases as the season progresses. Daily survival rates and the average number of fledglings per nest were similar in both groups of nests suggesting that the use of a spoon to analyse the diet have no impact on the nestlings. Conclusions: The main value of this method is that food samples are obtained before swallowed and thus the food is easy to recognize. This is an inexpensive method because the spoon tool can be used repeatedly.",diet analysis; goldfinch; gullet; nestling; spoon-spatule; food stored.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1364.pdf,June 2008,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/551/articles/49-57/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diurnal feeding, peaking at the start of the wintering period, exhibited a marked seasonal decline, mirrored by an increase in sleeping and swimming. Nocturnal feeding and sleeping were inversely correlated and they displayed, respectively, a progressive increase and decrease between October and March. Feeding peaked in the middle of the night when sleeping reached its lowest values. Flight was most prominent around dawn.",anatidae; diving ducks; population dynamics; time budget; daily activity; Algeria; North Africa.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1365.pdf,June 2008,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/551/articles/59-69/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Location: Pyrenean range, peninsular Spain. Methods: We modelled the spatial distribution of the species using multivariate statistical techniques and GIS (Geographic Information System). To infer the factors affecting the Tengmalm's owl distribution, and to find out favourable areas in Spain, a predictive distribution model was performed using a favourability function, presence/absence data of the species, and a set of 32 independent variables related to climatic conditions, spatial structuring, topography, lithology and human activity. Presence/absence data for the Spanish 10 x 10 km UTM squares were obtained from the Atlas of breeding birds of Spain. Variables included in the model were grouped in factors and we used a variation partitioning procedure to determine how much of the final model variation was explained by the pure effect of each of them in the model and by their interactions. Results: The resulting model included four variables, namely mean annual number of frost days, maximum precipitation in 24 hours, elevation range, and geographical longitude. Attending to the favourability values yielded, we obtained 107 favourable squares, 4971 unfavourable ones, and 89 classified as of intermediate favourability. Climate was the main factor affecting the Tengmalm's owl distribution, followed by pure spatial structure and topography. Conclusions: Our global predictive model describes satisfactorily the Tengmalm's owl distribution in Spain with a limited number of climatic, topographical and spatial structuring variables, suggesting that Eastern mountainous territories with many frost days per year and high levels of precipitation recorded in a day are favourable for the species. In Spain, Tengmalm's owl distribution seems to be mainly determined by climatic influence but the influence of spatial structuring may also indicate that Central European area acts as historic source of immigrants. We suggest that the role of French populations as a source population for the Spanish populations may be critical for the maintenance of this endangered species in Spain.",Aegolius funereus; Biogeography; Tengmalmâ€™s owl; spatial predictive models; variation partitioning,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1366.pdf,June 2008,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/551/articles/71-85/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: We systematically monitored a small population occupying 5 - 10 different territories, from 1982 to 2002, over a 1,500 km<sup>2</sup> study area. Results: A total of 120 breeding attempts were counted. The average breeding density in the study area was 0.41 ± 0.09 pairs / 100 km<sup>2</sup>. The number of breeding pairs increased from 5 in 1982 to 9 in 2002. No differences in breeding performance were detected, neither between territories nor between years. Nests were placed in caves, cracks and holes, and peregrines even used nests originally built by corvids and large eagles for breeding. Territory alternation with other cliff-nesting birds was frequent, with cliffs occupied by common ravens, Eurasian kestrels and Bonelli's eagles. Conclusions: The population has doubled since the beginning of the monitoring, twenty-one years ago. Breeding parameters are of the highest reported in the world, although it could be caused by a low sample size.

Several of these species can prosper in anthropogenic environments of which quarries are one of the most used. Owing to this adaptation to human-altered landscapes the cliff-nesting birds have access to an additional nesting habitat which acquires special relevance for the development of populations in highly modified environments or in areas where the availability of natural cliffs is limited. Abandoned quarries are especially relevant trough being selected more frequently due to a lesser incidence of human disturbances. The current management of abandoned quarries in Spain, promoted by legislation, frequently overlooks its ecological potential with the result that measures taken to improve the environment frequently act to the detriment of the cliff-nesting birds which occupied them. In a study carried out in Bizkaia, 73 quarries were inspected locating more than 192 breeding pairs of cliff-nesting birds of 12 species. 72.7 % of the abandoned and 38.9 % of the active quarries were occupied. The study noted the importance of these places on the conservation of the avian community in the province as well as the negative consequences of several of the landscape restoration projects undertaken.

Here we present the case of a southern European country (Spain) which has moved rapidly from widespread and long-term intense persecution of raptors until the 1970's to occupying a leading place in raptor study and conservation within Europe today. We argue that such a radical change may have a contingent component (the rapid and intensive urban concentration of rural people following economic growth of the country), as well as a more deterministic component (an active role of mass media increasing awareness to a concentrated population). This societal shift could inform future conservation strategies in countries currently undergoing rapid urbanisation.",raptors; conservation; social attitude; change; mass media; economic growth; persecution.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1370.pdf,June 2008,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/551/articles/111-119/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main goal will be to use these data to discuss about the possible scenario of colonization and extinctions events of this genus in the canary archipelago. Specifically, the possible causes affecting the current narrow distribution of the red-billed chough in the Canary Islands are discussed. Actually this species only breeds in La Palma, the most north-westerly island of the archipelago. Location: Four caves in three islands (La Palma, Tenerife and La Gomera) of the Canary archipelago. Methods: Fossil bones where identify through the combination of biometric and morphologic traits, and using Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA). Results: The bones studied were contrasted with both red-billed chough Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax and alpine chough P. graculus. Bones of the alpine chough were found on both Tenerife and La Palma, the highest islands in the Canary archipelago. These are the first records for this bird in the Canary Islands. On the other hand, the fossil record shows that red-billed chough was distributed at least on La Palma, Tenerife and La Gomera. Conclusions: It is suggested that the colonisation of choughs could be related to climatic changes affecting to the distribution of mainland biota during the Upper Pleistocene period. Alteration of island ecosystems by human arrival is also suggested asan hypothesis to explain local extinctions in the Canaries, such as has been proposed in other insular environments. Two main hypotheses to explain the current narrow distribution of red-billed chough are discussed: (i) It is the result of the survival of a part of the ancestral pool of choughs living in the Canary Islands; (ii) It is a direct consequence of new colonisation and/or reintroduction event.",Island biogeography; Canary Islands; extinction; palaeontology; Pyrrhocorax graculus; Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1315.pdf,December 2007,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/542/articles/185-195/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Location: The study was carried out in the Sierra de San Pedro (Extremadura, SW Spain). Methods: To achieve the aim, the diet of this carrion feeder in the 1970s (Hiraldo, 1976) was compared with that recorded in the period 1998 - 2000. The method used was based on analyzing fur-ball pellets collected in visits to nests over an annual cycle (125 pellets, 167 preys). Results: In the 1970s in the Sierra de San Pedro, this carrion feeder based its diet on carcasses of medium and small sized animals, with the rabbit constituting the key food item. In response to the growing scarcity of this prey, the black vulture has changed its feeding habits and now the percentage of rabbits in its diet is very low, having been replaced by sheep Ovies aries supplemented with other prey (swine and deer). Conclusions: The major growth of these resources and the protection of the species have led to the recovery of its populations. This capacity of the black vulture to adapt to change in the availability of prey may be a key element in the future conservation of the species, since new changes have recently been taking place in the availability of these resources (greater control of livestock carcasses and new European Community policies).",Aegypius monachus; black vulture; diet; Mediterranean ecosystems; scavengers; trophic plasticity,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1317.pdf,December 2007,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/542/articles/197-204/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Localization: Southern Portugal. Methods: Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric tests and Bailey's tests was used to analyse the preferences among biotopes, while logistic regression analysis was utilized to obtain an explanation model for species distributions during breeding and non-breeding seasons. Variables considered in the analysis included presence or absence of cattle; ground vegetation coverage, height and vertical density; tree density; bush coverage; slope exposition; stone coverage and number of stones; wind direction; habitat; soil capacity; distance to roads, drinking places and villages; and altitude. Results: The results of biotope selection indicated that sandgrouses preferred fields of leguminous plants during both breeding and non-breeding periods and tillage during the breeding period. Montado and fallows older than two years were avoided during the non-breeding season. Cereal fields were used according to their availability. Besides not significantly, fallows were highly used. For the explanation model, six variables that explain the species distribution during the breeding season were selected: cattle presence, stony ground and distance to secondary roads had a positive effect, while vegetation cover, stone cover and distance to the drinking places had a negative effect. During the non-breeding period, the model was not adjusted to validation sample. Conclusions: It was found that the most important biotopes are leguminous cultivations and fallows with extensive pastures. Grazing can have either a positive or a negative effect on these fields, depending on cattle density. Besides the number of small dams, drinking places are still a limiting factor for this species. Dispersion of settlements and roads is also negative to sandgrouse distribution. Finally conservation implications, namely management actions such as an enlargement of leguminous fields, cattle grazing control and modifications of Territory Management Plans, are discussed.",habitat selection; logistic regression; management actions; Pterocles orientalis; seasonal variation,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1318.pdf,December 2007,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/542/articles/205-215/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the economical costs of the upkeep of a white stork Ciconia ciconia colony at a cattle farm over a six-year period were evaluated. Furthermore, the effect of ash lopping in nest site selection and the efficacy of nest removal in controlling the population of this species was analysed. Location: The ash dehesa studied was located in the Northern area of the Madrid province, in both Soto del Real and Manzanares el Real localities (40º 44' N, 3º 49' E), from 1999 to 2004. Methods: Estimation was made of the economical cost of white stork colony maintenance by estimating the total weight of branches and bud shoots on the ashes. The tree type (lopped or unlopped) was noted to determine nest site selection where new nests were established in the subsequent year after lopping. Finally, it was recorded if removed nests (by the Regional Government as a method of population control) were less like to rebuilt in function of previous breeding success (failed or not). Results: Storks mainly selected lopped trees as nest sites. To avoid the increase of white stork pairs in the colony, lopping was not carried out in subsequent years, causing economical losses to landowners (a minimum of 13,902.33 â‚¬ in six years). In addition, due to the high nest-site fidelity in this species, the total number of nests in the colony was not reduced by nest removal. Nests that contained a pair that failed in their reproductive attempt were less likely to be rebuilt in the consecutive breeding season. The results showed that selective nest removal (removal of nests which failed the previous year) might be a more effective method for population control than nest removal methods used to date. Conclusions: Due to the low total economic cost of colony maintenance, it is proposed that economical compensation by the regional government to the farm owners will be a more effective management measure than nest removal.",Ciconia ciconia; lopping; nest removal; nest-site fidelity; wild species on private property,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1319.pdf,December 2007,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/542/articles/217-225/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Location: Salt pans situated in the Parque Natural de las Marismas del Odiel (ría de Huelva, Spain). Methods: Actively preening birds were arbitrarily selected. Each bird was observed for 2 minutes using a 20-60 x 60 telescope. For each focal bird air temperature, windspeed (using an anemometer), distance to the nearest conspecific at the start of monitoring, number of individual godwits and other waders and gulls in a radius of 10 m of the sampled bird and godwit position (central or peripheral) were recorded. Dependent variables recorded were vigilance time, scanning rate and scan duration. Results and Conclusions: Vigilance time and scanning rate were higher in peripheral godwits than in central godwits, while mean scan duration did not differ significantly between both groups. Using as predictors godwit position (central vs peripheral), presence or absence of black-headed gull and air temperature the best model to explain vigilance time (Akaike weight, w<sub>i</sub><sup> </sup>= 0.248) and scanning rate (w<sub>i</sub> = 0.427) included in both cases the godwit position, presence of black-headed gulls and air temperature. Godwit position was a consequential predictor with a negative effect of the central sites in the vigilance time and scanning rate. Black-headed gull presence and air temperature were two consequential predictors that influenced the increase of the vigilance time and scanning rate in roosting godwits. Birds may make postural changes to alter heat loss and we suggest that to increase heat loss the head may be more frequently raised after preening bout. In accordance with this hypothesis, in high temperatures the head rising in preening godwits could have antipredatory and thermoregulatory functions.",black-tailed godwit; Limosa limosa; preening; vigilance,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1320.pdf,December 2007,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/542/articles/227-235/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FURNESS,,"Aims: Coastal wetlands provide a diversity of prey to birds and thus variable diet-mediated mercury budgets. The main purpose of the study was to test the effect of dietary specialization and trophic status on mercury levels of birds using common coastal wetlands in a different manner, as revealed by stable isotopes signatures. Location: Seven saltpans and a large area of ricefields in Portugal. Methods: Total mercury concentration and stable isotope ratios were measured in chick feathers of black-winged stilt Himantopus himantopus and little tern Sterna albifrons, from Portuguese coastal wetlands during breeding seasons. Results and Conclusions: Variation in trophic status explained the inter-specific variation of mercury levels, the intra-specific variation of mercury levels in H. himantopus, but not the intra-specific variation of mercury levels in S. albifrons. A different diet specialization and a mixture of prey groups, teleosts and invertebrates from different saltpan ponds and trophic status are suggested as being the basis for intra-specific variation of mercury levels not being related with the trophic status in S. albifrons. H. himantopus only uses invertebrates, but a wide range of stable isotope signatures and mercury levels were observed. Because chicks are precocial, the feeding area may be associated with a confined area in the ricefield, in the saltpan or in the saltpan pond. Differences of d<sup>13</sup>C in chick feathers of H. himantopus between ricefields and saltpans, and also between saltpan ponds suggested that different contributions from marine versus freshwater sources exist among preys. Prey exhibited differences in d<sup>15</sup>N and mercury levels, and significant correlation between mercury concentration and d<sup>15</sup>N revealing that prey occupy different trophic status.

The significant few breeding success of pairs located in low density areas could be explained for the greater occurrence of factors related to human disturbance in open-agricultural lands in comparison to the nests in high density squares located in woodlands of Montes de Toledo.",Aquila adalberti; breeding success; distribution; population; Spanish imperial eagle; Toledo,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1326.pdf,December 2007,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/542/articles/309-317/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GARRIDO; Javier MARTÍN-JARAMILLO; Enrique ÁVILA; Agustín MADERO,,"An assessment was carried out on the potential effect of correcting power lines in juvenile dispersal areas of Bonelli´s eagle Hieraaetus fasciatus in Andalusia (southern Spain) on the reduction of mortality risk in the rest of raptor species. Three power lines located in three other Andalusian dispersal areas were intensively surveyed searching for raptors killed by electrocution. A total of 108 carcasses were found, 16 of Bonelli´s eagle (ca. 15 % of the total raptor mortality) and 92 belonging to other raptor species, It is estimated that a minimum of c.6 individuals (range: 3.5 - 7.4) of other bird of prey were killed for each Bonelli´s eagle electrocuted, irrespective of the raptor community characterizing each dispersal area. A minimum annual mortality rate of 7 Bonelli´s eagles and 37 other raptors was estimated for the last ten years in the whole Bonelli´s eagle dispersal areas of Andalusia, although the real rate must be higher. It was concluded that the Bonelli´s eagle can be considered as an ""umbrella species"" as conservation funds focused on correcting dangerous power lines in the dispersal areas of this species can avoid the risk of electrocution for many other birds of prey.",,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1327.pdf,December 2007,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/542/articles/319-325/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SOLER; Juan Gabriel MARTÍNEZ; TomÁs PÉREZ-CONTRERAS,,"Aims: The existence of a size hierarchy of nestlings in a brood facilitates a secondary readjustment of brood size to resource availability, through the death of the smaller chicks when food is scarce. A mechanism to facilitate brood reduction would be for parents preferentially to feed the biggest nestlings in the nest. Therefore, feeding rules employed by adults are important because they predetermine the extent of brood reduction when food is scarce. In this study, feeding rules are studied in a species with habitual brood reduction, the black-billed magpie (Pica pica). Location: Hoya de Guadix, southeastern Spain. Methods: Nests were filmed using a micro-camera. Results: Parents preferentially fed the bigger nestlings, and those with higher begging levels, i. e. those which came closer to parents, responded most quickly, had higher begging intensity and adopted a higher posture when begging. Moreover, the preference by parents for the biggest nestlings was independent of the level of begging and the position in the nest. The process of multiple feeding (when more than one nestling was fed during one feeding event) was also analysed, in relation to nestling age and size: such events were more frequent with younger chicks in the nest, and when the first chick fed was relatively small. Conclusions: Results are congruent with the adaptive brood reduction hypothesis.",begging behaviour; black-billed magpie; brood reduction; food allocation; parental investment; Pica pica; reproductive strategies,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1299.pdf,June 2007,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/541/articles/15-25/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PERRINS; Andrew G. GOSLER,,"Aims: In order to discern principal evolutionary trends in the Canary Island blue tits (Cyanistes teneriffae) this study provides the first comprehensive description of the main life history traits for this passerine bird in the most important habitat types (laurel forest, pine forest and Phoenix / Tamarix community) on two contrasting islands (i. e. Tenerife and Fuerteventura). Location: one study site on pine forest and laurel forest of Tenerife and one location on Phoenix / Tamarix on Fuerteventura (Canary Islands). Methods: 250 nestboxes were monitored from December to July (2000 - 2004) and the following parameters were collected: the date of laying (i. e. day of first egg), clutch size (number of eggs laid in a clutch), breeding success (hatched young-dead in nest/eggs laid x 100), second clutches (laid in the same nestbox from which a brood of young had already fledged successfully), percentage of second clutches (number of females that laid a second clutch/ number of females that laid a first clutch x 100). Data on nestling weights were obtained daily in the laurel forest of Tenerife during the breeding season of 2002. In the pine forest of Tenerife (year 2002) birds were caught in the boxes when nestlings were c. 8 days old. These were aged in two classes: first year and older birds, based on plumage characteristics. Results: When compared with data across the entire range, the Canary Island blue tit was similar in weight and growth pattern, but revealed extreme cases of life-history traits such as the earliest mean laying date (3 February, Fuerteventura), the lowest mean clutch size (4.0 ± 0.88 eggs, Tenerife laurel forest), and the highest percentage of second clutches (40.8 % Tenerife laurel forest). Conclusions: Our study suggests that the laurel forest seems to be the optimal habitat for this species in terms of chick productivity. We provide evidence, inferred from our data, that this low reproductive rate was counterbalanced by high adult survival and greater longevity. Therefore, tits on these islands have evolved trends often found on oceanic islands as a consequence of a severe insular syndrome.

The main purpose of this paper was to advance into the knowledge of the ecological features that allow those species to survive in urban environments and to identify which sets of characters enhance the risk of local extinction. Location: Puebla-Cholula Conurbation (PCC), in México, a developing country between the Nearctic and Neotropical Regions. Methods: First, 355 qualitative point counts (Echantillonnage Frecuentiels Progressifs) were performed in 21 green areas of the PCC to determine the regional distribution and local abundance of 51 species. Then, groups of species were formed through multivariate cluster analysis as a function of their similarity in distribution and abundance. Finally, bird species were characterized (body length, body mass, type of diet and migration status) and multivariate clusters were analyzed to look for differences between groups (through Kruskall-Wallis ANOVA), and also with the avifauna from evergreen oak forest communities described in the literature. Results: Regional distribution of great-tailed grackle, house finch and house sparrow were maximal, since they were found in all the 21 study areas; local abundances of these species, plus those of inca dove and rock dove, were also high (incidence > 50 %). Regional distribution of seven species (like acorn woodpecker, townsend's warbler or rose-breasted grosbeak) was minimal, since they were located in just one site; and six species exhibited very low local abundances (incidence",Abundance; birds; body size; diet; distribution; migration; multivariate cluster analysis; urbanization,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1302.pdf,June 2007,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/541/articles/53-67/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Location: During five summers between 1997 and 2005, migratory blackcaps were studied in Álava and Madrid, and sedentary blackcaps were studied in the Campo de Gibraltar area. Wintering birds were also studied in the Campo de Gibraltar area (nine winters: 1997 - 2006), where migratory and sedentary blackcaps occur in sympatry. Methods: Morphological traits (wing length, wing pointedness and tail length) of birds captured during summer were used to carry out a DFA for distinguishing between migratory and sedentary individuals during winter. The performance of DFA was tested by (1) observation of the percentage of correct classifications of sedentary blackcaps (ringed birds captured in both seasons), and (2) analysing variation between summer and winter in posterior classification probabilities (P<sub>C</sub>) of birds classified as either migratory or sedentary. Results: The DFA correctly classified 88 % of summer blackcaps, and it still worked well in winter as shown by 20 out of 21 wintering birds known to be sedentary (by ringing recoveries) being correctly classified. P<sub>C</sub> increased during winter in birds classified as migratory, due to the arrival to southern Iberia of northern birds with higher migratory-like trait values. As expected from the fact that the sedentary population stays in the area through the year, sedentary blackcaps were classified with similar P<sub>C</sub> in both seasons. Conclusions: DFA based on the morphological differentiation between migratory and sedentary blackcaps correctly classifies individuals during sympatric wintering periods, which is when the DFA is meant to be used. This study shows that a suitable way to validate morphological DFA is comparing the P<sub>C</sub> of birds used to generate the functions with the P<sub>C</sub> of birds that need to be classified.

Discriminant Function Analysis was used to help in discriminating the sex of individuals of both populations. Location: Badajoz (Spain) and Kraghede (Denmark). Methods: Two discriminant functions were obtained using biometric data from adult individuals, one for each European population. These functions were validated using external data from a sample of an Italian and Ukrainian barn swallow populations. Results: Three morphometric variables: the length of the outermost tail feathers, the length of the inner tail feathers and the length of the keel were retained in the discriminant function in the two populations studied. Overall, these functions allowed us to determine the sex of adult birds with 90.1 % and 91.9 % accuracy for the Spanish and the Danish populations, respectively. External validation using a sample from the Italian population to validate Spanish discriminant function and from the Ukrainian population to validate the Danish discriminant function showed that 91 % of Italian and 86 % of Ukrainian swallows were correctly classified.

CARRASCAL; Oscar GORDO; Joan PINO,,"Bias in avian sampling effort due to human preferences: an analysis with Catalonian birds (1900 - 2002). Aims: To investigate the sources of spatial bias in the bird records of Catalonia from 1900 to 2002, with the aim of providing generalized recommendations for using other databases, and setting up broad inventory projects. The paper examines the influence of environmental variables, human distribution and ornithological preferences of birdwatchers on past avian sampling effort in Catalonia, a contrasting region in the north east of Spain. Location: Catalonia (Spain). Methods: The relationship between time (field days) devoted to sampling birds in 10 x 10 km UTM squares (from the records of VertebraCat database, across 5 study periods from 1900 to 2002) and a set of environmental, human distribution and bird species richness variables was analysed. These relationships were analysed by means of Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and multiple regression analyses. Results: A partial least squares regression analysis accounted for 39.4% of the spatial variation in time devoted to avian sampling per UTM 10 x 10 km square in the most recent (1983 - 2002) period. The major pattern shows that large visit frequencies were mainly associated with coastal areas with a large cover of wetlands, marshes and sand dunes, high human population density, dense transportation, and also high covers of irrigated croplands, urban and industrial environments. Another group of highly visited UTM squares was also covered with a large surface of protected areas, mostly located in mountainous Catalonian sectors, as opposed to those UTM squares in lowland areas mainly covered by non-irrigated extensive croplands. Catalonian ornithologists and birdwatchers also showed an uneven preference for different groups of bird species, as they mainly relied on migratory and endangered species. Conclusions: The illustrated biased pattern of ornithological field work in Catalonia cats doubts about the usefulness of biodiversity indices obtainable from databases of observation records without a random-stratifield sampling approach. However, these problems might be overcome by including a variable of sampling bias such as the number of records or days of field work.",Birds; birdwatcher preferences; Catalonia; environmental characteristics; sampling biases,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1279.pdf,December 2006,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/532/articles/213-227/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GREEN; Fernando IBAÑEZ; Manuel MAÑEZ; José Luís DEL VALLE; Héctor GARRIDO; José Luís ARROYO; Rubén RODRÍGUEZ,,"Aims: We derived two discriminant equations to sex glossy ibis Plegadis falcinellus chicks (2 - 5 weeks old) based on morphological characters. Location: Doñana, South-West Spain. Methods: Wing length and tarsus length and width of 198 individuals were measured in the 2002 and 2003 breeding seasons. Results: Tarsus width was the most discriminant character and in combination with wing length allowed us to sex 86.9% of individuals correctly. A formula based on wing and tarsus length also sexed 84.9% of individuals correctly. The reliability of this second equation was also tested with an independent sample of 209 individuals measured in 2004, with error rates similar to those of the original data. Intervals for discriminant scores reducing errors in sexing to 10% or 5% were derived, at the cost of reducing the proportion of individuals that can be sexed. These equations should not be applied in other localities without validation, but our analyses suggest they can be used on different cohorts. We also describe a visual sexing technique found to have 95% accuracy for an experienced observer. Conclusions: Sex can be reliably determined for many glossy ibis chicks. Given the considerable sexual size dimorphism found in many species of the family Threskionidae, tarsus width is likely to be a good variable to include in future analyses of sexual dimorphism in spoonbills and ibises.",discriminant function; genetic analyses; glossy ibis; leg morphology; sex determination; sexual size dimorphism; Plegadis falcinellus,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1280.pdf,December 2006,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/532/articles/229-235/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HÓDAR,,"Aims: The study of the diet and prey selection of the Southern grey shrike. Location: Two shrubsteppes of South-eastern Spain. Methods: The diet is determined by pellet analysis, and then compared with samples of prey availabilityrecorded by means of pitfall traps, on a monthly basis during an annual cycle. Results: The Southern grey shrike consumes several beetle types, grasshoppers, and, during the breedingperiod, lizards. Birds and small mammals are captured incidentally. It consistently rejects prey smallerthan 10 mm long, and prey are larger during the breeding period and summer. Compared with otherpopulations of Southern grey shrike and also with Northern grey shrike, the population studied here showsa greater importance of lizards in the diet. Birds and mammals, which are progressively more frequent indiet as latitude increases, both in breeding and wintering periods, are here at low frequency. Conclusions: The diet of the Southern grey shrike in South Spain combines arthropods (mainly between10 and 30 mm in length) and lizards. The changes in the taxonomic groups captured along an annualcycle and their sizes suggest that, apart of the weak limits of prey size described, the Southern greyshrike is quite opportunistic when feeding, and captures any prey of the adequate size available, regardlessof their taxonomy.

CARRASCAL; Javier SEOANE; David PALOMINO; César Luis ALONSO,,"Aims: To quantify the population size and the distribution patterns of the houbara bustard (Chlamydotis undulata fuertaventurae) in Lanzarote and La Graciosa islands (Canary Islands). To analyze habitat preferences of the species according to topographic, soil, vegetation and human impact variables. Location: Lanzarote and La Graciosa islands (Canary Islands). Methods: Bird censuses using the line transect method and the estimation of detection probabilities. Bootstrap to calculate the confidence interval of population size estimations. Classification trees were used to analyze the effect of habitat descriptors on bird species occurrence in 671 0.5 km-transects. Results: The population size of the houbara bustard was 500 birds (90% confidence interval: 272-801) in Lanzarote and 6 birds (3 - 10) in La Graciosa. The average density in the occupied semiarid environments was 1.63 birds/km<sup>2</sup> in Lanzarote and 0.32 birds/km<sup>2</sup> in La Graciosa. The maximum ecological density recorded was 3 birds/km2. The most important areas for the species were the steppe plains of Famara- Soo-Zonzamas, Guatiza and Teguise (202 km<sup>2</sup>), where 85% of the whole population of Lanzarote is included. Slope of the terrain, rock cover on the ground and the density of roads and unpaved tracks had a highly negative influence on the habitat preferences of the houbara bustard. The probability of occurrence of the species increased as the distance to the nearest urban area also increased. Habitat descriptors related to vegetation structure played a minor role in the distribution of the houbara bustard. Conclusions: According to the data provided by this paper, and those previously published in 1990 decade, the population of houbara bustard in Lanzarote has shown a 40% increase in the last 10-15 years. Only 20% of this population is included in protected areas. The density of the species in Lanzarote is the highest recorded in the whole geographic range of the species in northern Africa and central Asia. Although the species has a favourable protection status in Lanzarote and La Graciosa, conservation efforts should be reinforced in order to preserve semiarid grasslands and shrublands with a steepness of the terrain lower than 15%, a rock cover less than 60%, a low density of roads and tracks (less than 0.5 km/20 ha) and away from urban sprawls (at least further than 650 m).",houbara Bbustard; Lanzarote; Canary Islands; habitat preferences; population size; demographic trends; conservation measures; steppe-land environments,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1282.pdf,December 2006,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/532/articles/251-269/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this, the factors shaping bird numbers and species richness in this habitat have not been studied. This paper examines the bird communities in a set of bogs distributed in two Peruvian localities during the wet (February) and dry (September) season. It evaluates the effects of bog size and some habitat features (grazing intensity, presence of small watercourses, vegetation cover, etc.) on abundance and species richness of bird communities. Location: Two Peruvian localities above 4,000 m (humid mountains near Cusco, and arid uplands near Arequipa). Methods: Given that bogs tended to be long and narrow (mean width: 59 m, range 10 - 200 m), birds were counted along three parallel, simultaneous transects covering the full area of bogs. Independent variables evaluated were the size (ha), altitude (m above sea level), slope (0-90º), presence/absence of small permanent watercourses and cover (%) of water, meadows and cushion-like Yareta shrubs in each study bog. Grazing intensity was estimated by counting the number of faecal pellet groups (of alpacas and other livestock) inside a one-metre-wide band transect. Results: Results support the view that bogs operate as local ""hotspots"" for birds, as they maintain species associated with different habitats, such as rivers and lakes (Anas flavirostris, Anas specularoides, etc.), wet meadows (Vanellus resplendens, Chloephaga melanoptera, Cinclodes fuscus, Lessonia oreas, etc.) or bunch-grass steppes (Metriopelia aymara, Thinocorus orbignyianus, etc.). Bird species richness and numbers were positively correlated with bog size and, after controlling for this effect, species richness increased in those arid upland bogs crossed by small watercourses during the dry period. This supports the key role of water availability on the bird communities of these steppes. No effect of grazing intensity and other habitat features were recorded. Conclusions: From a conservation perspective, bog size and the presence of permanent watercourses seem to be two focal criteria for prioritizing relevant bogs for protection and can also be used as key guidelines for evaluating the pervasive effects of the reduction and alteration of bogs by public works (roads), agricultural encroachment or draining.",bogs; bird richness and abundance; bog size; conservation; grazing intensity; permanent watercourses; Peruvian Andes; puna,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1283.pdf,December 2006,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/532/articles/271-283/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UNAMUNO; Alberto MONTEAGUDO; Graciela FERNÁNDEZ; Xosé M. CARREGAL; Emilio BARBA,,"Aims: Data on proportions of subspecies of bluethroat in different localities in Spain were analysed, in order to know if there is a geographic segregation during the autumn migration period. Location: Bluethroats were caught at nine Ringing Stations in the North of Spain (Cantabrian: Fuenterrabía, Gautegiz-Arteaga, Villaviciosa, Ponteceso and Ribeira; Villafranca and Castronuño in the Ebro and Duero Basin, respectively), Central Spain (San Martín de la Vega) and the Southeastern Spain (Elche). Methods: In order to distinguish the subspecies, the age and sex of each bird were determined and its wing length recorded. Thereafter, data on proportions were analysed with c2-based tests. Results: Two subspecies were registered (L. s. cyanecula and L. s. namnetum), occurring they both at all the sampling localities, though proportions significantly varied. L. s. svecica only appeared in SE Spain, and in low proportions, supporting that this subspecies in Spain is an accidental bird (even in SE most, if not all individuals may have been classified by error as L. s. svecica). Highest proportion of L. s. namnetum were registered along Cantabrian coast (on average, more than 70 %), followed by Duero (almost 20 %) and the Ebro basins, C and SE Spain (on average, less than 5 %). Conclusions: Data support a geographic segregation of L. s. namnetum and L. s. cyanecula in Spain, during the autumn migration period. L. s. namnetum migrates mainly along northern coast of Spain (though deviating some specimens to Duero basin).

RAMOS; José PEREIRA",,"Aims: To study the foraging ecology of roseate terns and common terns in the Azores sub-tropical waters where the former species is relatively abundant compared to congeners. In particular, we asked whether foraging behaviour differed between both species, which factors determined individual success at foraging- flocks, and how did our findings compare with previous studies of Atlantic populations in North America (temperate), and Caribbean (tropical). Location: Ponta das Contendas (38°39â€™N, 27°05â€™W), Terceira Island, Azores. Methods: Foraging-flocks were characterized and compared in terms of species (single- or mixedspecies), size (no. of individuals), type of habitat (inshore, exposed coast, deep blue water), and presenceabsence of biotic effects. We used a generalized linear model (GLM) approach to study the effect of selected factors (species, habitat, biotic effect, cloud cover, wind speed, and their interactions) on individual foraging parameters at these flocks (number of dives min-1, number of aborted dives min-1, number of prey caught min -1). Results: Both tern species were most often observed in mixed-flocks in the exposed coast habitat, but roseate terns were also prone to feed in mono-specific flocks over blue water. Only one quarter of the total number of flocks recorded was in the presence of biotic effects, a situation where common terns, but not roseate terns, were twice more numerous. The GLM results suggested that species and habitat alone were good predictors of prey caught min-1: common terns achieved the highest success in inshore bays (1.2 fish min-1) while roseate terns maximized their success on exposed coasts (0.8 fish min-1). In the presence of biotic effects, both species dove at a higher frequency, and aborted fewer dives per min, but there was no marked effect on capture rates. Increasing wind speed negatively affected the rate at which both species aborted dives, but again, there was no effect on capture success. Conclusions: Foraging success did not increase in the presence of biotic associations that should normally facilitate prey capture. This suggests that interspecies competition may arise at mixed-flocks, as found in North American studies. Overall, our results paralleled previous findings that the common tern is adapted to feed in calm, inshore bays. Because this latter habitat was scarce in the study area, we hypothesized that this contributes towards explaining why common terns do not breed in high numbers at this colony site (ten percent of the Azores population). Conversely, the large area occupied by the marine coastal (exposed coast) and oceanic (blue water) environments in the study area may, at least in part, justify the large number of roseate terns found there (one quarter of the Azores population) in 2001.",roseate tern; common tern; foraging success; predatory fish; foraging competition; seabird conservation; Azores; Sterna dougallii; Sterna hirundo,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1285.pdf,December 2006,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/532/articles/293-306/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some evidence suggests that yolk androgen deposition may be a costly investment for the female bird. We studied the relationship between female expression of a male ornament and yolk androgen deposition in the pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca). In this species, some females present a white forehead patch, which is an ornament typically restricted to males. Female expression of this trait has previously been found to be associated with older age and low levels of blood parasites. We predicted that, if yolk androgen deposition is costly, eggs from females displaying a white forehead patch should contain higher concentrations of yolk androgens that those laid by females lacking that ornament. Location: La Hiruela, central Spain. Methods: We measured testosterone (T) and androstenedione (A4) levels in 10 pied flycatcher broods, after an ether extraction, following a radioimmunoassay method. Results and Conclusions: We found that yolk T and A4concentrations increased with laying order. However, the increase in A4 with laying order was steeper for females without a forehead patch than for those expressing it. Also, and contrary to expectations, we found a marginally significant trend for females with white foreheads to have lower yolk-T levels. We discuss these results with reference to the adaptive function of hatching asynchrony.",yolk androgens; testosterone; pied flycatcher; hatching asynchrony; female ornamentation,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1286.pdf,December 2006,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/532/articles/307-315/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SERRANO-VELA; Juan IRA-CACHAFEIRO; Antonio ARNAIZ-VILLENA,,"Aims: Canaries and goldfinches seem to form a phylogenetic group separated from other Carduelini tribe radiations. The present study conjointly analyses for the first time the phylogenetic relationships among canaries (genus Serinus) and goldfinches (genus Carduelis), and others, and the particular case of citril finch (Serinus citrinella) which has been included by different authors either in the canaries or in the goldfinches group. Also, two new species: Serinus totta and Serinus syriacus have been newly DNA sequenced and studied. Location: Eurasian, African and American canary and siskin-goldfinches species living range was surveyed. Also, island (Corsica and Sardinia) and continental (Madrid, Alps and Pyrenees) citril finch individuals were analysed. Methods: Mitochondrial cytochrome b (mt cyt b) DNA gene was sequenced. Parsimony and genetic distance based methodologies were used for dendrograms construction. Enforced constraints were used to test the inclusion of Citril Finch within either Serinus or Carduelis groups. Results and Discussion: Canaries and goldfinches may or may not be different genetic radiations with different evolutionary pathways. However it is confirmed that canaries are the closest Fringillidae family relatives to goldfinches, because canaries and goldfinches have conjointly been compared in the same dendrograms, also with the Fringillidae subfamilies: Peucedraminae, Emberizinae and Fringillinae (tribes Carduelini, Fringillini and Drepanidini), as indicated in Table 1. Also, each of these groups shows monophyletic and non-monophyletic supported subgroups as indicated by bootstrap values. Citril finch is definitively included within the genus Carduelis. This is supported by cladistic, and distance-based phylogenetic molecular analyses; it was also postulated by Bernis in 1954 based on phenetics. Citril finch island individuals seem to be more ancient than those extant in the continent. Genus Loxia (crossbills) is included within genus Carduelis. Serinus totta seems to cluster with the small African canaries clade and Serinus syriacus is included within the Serinus pusillus/ Serinus alario subgroup.

FARGALLO; Vicente POLO; José MARTÍN; Manuel SOLER,,"Aims: Subcolonies of penguins differ markedly in physical characteristics and in breeding success. Subcolony size is the best studied subcolony characteristic and has been suggested to be an important factor explaining the variation in reproductive success. Small subcolonies generally have lower breeding success, probably because they suffer from worse environmental conditions. It is likely that lower quality individuals also occupy smaller subcolonies, which in turn affects breeding success. However, results are not always consistent, and other subcolony characteristics may mediate breeding success. In the present study, the relationship is investigated between physical subcolony characteristics (slope, isolation and size) and several variables indicative of individual quality and breeding success in the chinstrap penguin Pygoscelis antarctica. Location: The study was performed in the Vapour Col chinstrap penguin colony on Deception Island (South Shetlands Archipelago, 63° 00' S, 60° 40' W) during the austral 2002-03 breeding season. Methods: The slope, the degree of isolation and the size (number of nests) of 22 randomly selected subcolonies were measured. Variables indicating individual quality were considered in 10 nests of each subcolony: parental body size (bill length, bill depth, flipper length), nest size and egg size, and variables indicating breeding success: hatching date and hatching success. Results: Both isolated and sloped subcolonies were smaller in size, and were occupied by male parents with shorter bills and less bill depth respectively. Isolated subcolonies also showed a delayed hatching date and lower hatching success and females of more sloped subcolonies laid smaller eggs. Nest size was larger in isolated subcolonies and smaller in sloped subcolonies. Conclusions: This study indicates that physical characteristics of subcolonies, such as the degree of isolation and slope, rather than just size, affect breeding success of chinstrap penguins. It is also suggested that nest size could be an indicator of individual quality only if it is compared within the same subcolony or if the effect of subcolony is taking into account.",colonial breeding; nest placement; penguins; egg size; bill size; flipper length; hatching date; hatching success; nest size,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1261.pdf,June 2006,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/531/articles/19-29/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Michael B. KING; Salima HAMIDI,,"Aims: To investigate if male and female blackcaps show differences in the amplitude of migratory movements. Methods: The extent of movements of male and female British blackcaps were analysed using ringing recovery records. Furthermore, through a literature review and the collection of original field data, the sex-ratios of blackcap samples taken at several latitudes in Europe and Africa were compared. Results: There were no differences between British male and female blackcaps in relation to wintering latitude or distance moved during migration. Sex-ratios of blackcap samples were quite even across a wide range of latitudes. However, there was a significantly larger proportion of females in samples of birds that wintered in Africa. Conclusions: Laboratory data and morphological studies have yielded inconclusive results in relation to the question of whether or not European blackcaps are differential distance migrants. The results from the present study suggest that British blackcaps are not differential distance migrants. Furthermore, there is, at best, only a weak latitudinal segregation of the sexes of blackcaps wintering in Europe and Africa. The slightly higher proportion of males in European samples, when compared to Africa, could result from a differential behaviour of males and females in some blackcap populations, or simply result from differences in the sex-ratios of blackcap populations breeding and wintering in different areas. An absence of a pronounced latitudinal segregation in the size-monomorphic blackcap is interesting, and contrasts with the pattern found in more sexually dimorphic species, such as the chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita or the robin Erithacus rubecula.",Sex-ratio; ringing recoveries; Europe; Africa; Morocco; Portugal,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1262.pdf,June 2006,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/531/articles/31-38/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conclusions: Differences exist in the prey size during the nesting period, probably as a consequence of the participation of the females in the hunt, as well as a significant difference in the prey size depending on the sex as a consequence of the reversed sexual size dimorphism (RSD) of the species.",Hieraaetus pennatus; booted eagle; methodology; songbirds; diet; RSD,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1263.pdf,June 2006,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/531/articles/39-54/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The multiple aim is (1) to census the population of dupont´s lark in a Natura Network area, (2) to develop spatial models to assess the driving factors of their spatial pattern and take into account the spatial fragmentation of their habitat patches, and (3) to develop a map of the probability presence of dupont´s lark in order to support conservation strategies. Location: Nature Network area in northern Spain (Ebro Basin). Methods: Census mapping using GPS; Generalised Additive Models, GAM, as non-parametric regression tool inserted in a GIS framework. Results and Conclusions: Density is around 0.40 - 0.51 per 10 ha. Dupont´s lark shows a high habitat preference related to sparse steppe areas, flat areas and scarcely fragmented landscapes. Incorrect interpretations of Community Agrarian Policy (CAP) are over-exploiting steppe areas and putting in danger the viability of this species in this area.

CARRASCAL,,"Aims: To study the habitat features affecting the risk of nest predation of birds nesting on the ground or the shrub layer in pyrenean oakwood forests of central Spain, and the variation across different forest areas. Location: Four pyrenean oak Quercus pyrenaica forests in the Sistema Central (Madrid, Spain). Methods: Estimation of predation rates of artificial wicker nests baited with two quail eggs in four oakwood sites spanning over 700 km2. Predation rates of individual nests were related, by means of generalized logistic regression models, to different forest locations, habitat features in nest surroundings, and shrub species characteristics where artificial nests were placed. Results: Variation in predation pressure was explainable to a low extent by predictor variables (less than 33 % of the original deviance). The most remarkable differences in predation pressure were attributable to forest location. Predation risk of artificial nests placed on shrubs decreased with the development of the shrub layer around the nests, and increased in places with a high density of young trees and a large cover of the herbaceous layer. Shrub characteristics related to the probable accessibility of nests did not influence predation risk. Conclusions: This study demonstrates a small effect of habitat structure of the nest surroundings on the predation risk of nests placed on the ground or shrubs within pyrenean oakwood areas. A trend towards a lower predation pressure was observed in areas with less immature trees and a large shrub cover 10 m around the shrub nests. However, forest tracts where the nests were placed largely determined the predation risk they suffered to an extent not directly associated with habitat structure.",nest predation; artificial nest; variation across woodland areas; habitat structure; nest site features,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1265.pdf,June 2006,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/531/articles/69-81/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Location: Bizkaia (Northern Spain) and Murcia (Southern Spain). Methods: Two populations of common buzzard were studied, one from 1996-2003 in Bizkaia (Northern Spain, Eurosiberian region) and the other one from 1998-2003 in Murcia (Southeastern Spain, semiarid Mediterranean region). Breeding parameters and diet were obtained every year. Home range habitat preferences were examined by comparing habitat composition around 18 occupied sites and 17 non-occupied sites in both areas, using logistic regression and two-sample tests. Results: The density was 45 territories per 100 km<sup>2</sup> in Bizkaia and 8 territories per 100 km<sup>2</sup> in Murcia. Productivity was similar in both areas at 1.72 and 2 fledged young per successful pair respectively. Diet was dominated by small-sized prey in Bizkaia and medium-sized prey in Murcia. More intensive timber management in Bizkaia caused buzzards to select mature pine forest, independently of the size of the forest patch. In contrast, timber management practices in Murcia result in continuous pine forests, where Common buzzards selected mature patches far from the forest edge. Moreover, buzzards appear to avoid sources of human disturbance in both areas. Conclusions: Differences in habitat structure between the regions appear to drive differences in density. Moreover, prey diversity differed between regions probably partly as a response to timber management and this probably contributes to the observed differences in population structure. Common buzzards appear to respond to habitat alteration in a variety of ways, ranging from their choice of forest structural characteristics to the placement of the nest site.",Buteo buteo; common buzzard; diet; habitat selection; timber management,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1266.pdf,June 2006,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/531/articles/83-98/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GREEN; Mustapha EL HAMZAOUI,,"Aims: To study the spatial associations of non-breeding marbled teal Marmaronetta angustirostris with other wintering waterbirds. To assess the information such interspecific associations can provide about habitat requirements of globally threatened species. Location: Sidi Bou Ghaba (34º 10' N, 06º 39' W), a closed-basin lagoon on the Atlantic coast of north-west Morocco. Methods: Flock-scan sampling during eight days in February 1995, five in March 1995 and two in October 1997. Results: In February and March, marbled teal showed a positive spatial association with gadwall Anas strepera, green-winged teal A. crecca and crested coot Fulica cristata and a negative association with mallard A. platyrhynchos and gulls. There was a very different pattern in October, when marbled teal had a positive association with mallard and a negative one with crested coot. In March, individual marbled teal positioned at different distances to the shoreline were significantly associated with different waterbird species along a continuum from crested coot (closest to shoreline) to greater flamingo Phoenicopterus ruber (farthest). Similarly, individuals in different behaviours were associated with different waterbird species, those swimming being most associated with flamingos and northern pintail A. acuta. This is because swimming teal tended to be in the most open areas frequented by these species. Conclusions: The interspecific associations of marbled teal covary with the behaviour and microhabitat use of individual birds. Studying the spatial association between a threatened species and other birds can provide misleading information on the habitat requirements of the former if results are inconsistent over space and time. This illustrates the complexities of studying the habitat selection of waterbirds.",habitat selection; marbled teal; Morocco; spatial distribution; wintering waterfowl,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1267.pdf,June 2006,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/531/articles/99-106/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Location: Four populations in Iberian Peninsula (three populations from Navarre and one population from Cáceres). Methods: A small blood sample was obtained from 242 captured shrikes. An analysis has been carried out of the control region for the mitrocondrial DNA. The DNA was extracted and a fragment was amplified using primers DLL2 and FTPH2. The results were analysed by means of the Arlequin program for haplotype frequencies. Results: Birds with two, three and 2+3 tandem repeats were recorded. The percentage of shrikes with two or three repeats did not differ either between populations or sexes. The presence of heteroplastic shrikes in two of the four populations was few frequent (1.6 % of the 242 birds studied).

In line with these studies, the aim of this study was to investigate variations in breeding phenology and nesting habitat between north-facing high quality areas (Vansa) and south-facing low quality areas (Bofia) as well as east-facing areas of intermediate quality (Port Comte / Sucre). Since the species habitat requirements have been little studied before, another aim of this study was the recording of some basic data on the phenology of this species and its nesting habitat in Spain. Location: The slopes of Port del Comte mountain (Catalonian Pre-Pyrenees). Results and Conclusions: As expected, variations were found in breeding phenology and nesting habitat. Birds on the moister and cooler north-and east-facing slopes (Vansa, Port Comte) started breeding earlier than did birds from the drier and sunnier south-facing slopes (Bofia). All nests at the slightly more elevated locality of Bofia were built in mountain pines Pinus mugo, while at the other two study sites a small proportion of the nests were also situated in scots pines Pinus sylvestris. Nests were built mainly in the top of the trees or in large side branches at a similar height above ground. At Bofia solitary trees were more often used instead of tree groups or forest than at the other sites. Furthermore, nests were situated at greater distance from each other and the proportion of subadult birds with breeding activity was higher at Bofia.",Citril finch; Carduelis citrinella; breeding phenology; nesting habitat; inter-locality variation,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1269.pdf,June 2006,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/531/articles/115-126/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test the predictions of global climatic change and the hypothesis of ""abundance centers"" on the frequency of occurrence of these species within the Iberian Peninsula. Methods: The frequency of occurrence of each species in UTM squares of 10 x 10 km within blocks of 50 x 50 km was modeled by means of regression tree analyses using 26 geographic, climatological and land-use variables. Residuals of these models in each one of the 190 blocks of 50 x 50 km (i. e., distribution patterns in Iberia not related to autoecological-environmental preferences) were related to the distances to the European barycenter of each species. Results: The models summarizing the basic environmental preferences of the 17 species accounted for an average 78.3 % of variation in the frequency of occurrence within the Iberian Peninsula. There was a common selection for areas located at higher altitudes or in mountains, the avoidance of agricultural landscapes, and a tight relationship with climatic variables (especially insolation). The frequency of occurrence of the 17 turdid species in Spain was not markedly influenced by the distances to their European distribution barycenters. Conclusions: The large-scale distribution patterns of the 17 turdid species in the Iberian Peninsula can be adequately explained considering coarse-grained environmental variables. Climatic variables were highly influential, although their effects do not support current predictions on alteration of distribution patterns due to global warming.

Location: Steppes in northern Spain. Method: Through Delphi process, the assessment of twenty one experts was obtained on the measures and effects of an agri-environment scheme for steppe birds (ecological value). For each measure, the value was related to the area treated (ecological effectiveness) and its economic cost (cost effectiveness). Results: Experts assessed the measures as positive, reaching a higher ecological value those that implied an increase in the surface or the ecological quality of set aside agricultural areas, those that eliminated direct causes of mortality and the creation of refuge areas. For ecological effectiveness, the most important are the measures which are highly valued ecologically and have a wide area of application. Cost effectiveness penalizes those areas with poor ecological effectiveness and significant economic cost. Conclusions: Assessment of agri-environment schemes by an expert group suggests benefits, but no good opinion of the livestock management measures was detected. It is important to reach a great area of application for the efficacy of these schemes, without neglecting specific measures over small areas aimed at solving crucial aspects of the conservation of threatened species.

Its confirmed breeding population has increased from 1 breeding pair in 1989 to 13 breeding pairs in 2001. The present study provides information about the population and the nesting habitat selection of the Booted Eagle in central Catalonia from 1990-2001. Location: central Catalonia. Methods: The data of presence of the Booted eagle in the studied area was obtained from April to August (1990-2001). The representation of the located nests has been made by means of a UTM projection square grid 10x10 km. To describe the characteristics of the nesting habitat, the occupied territories have been compared with equal number of random sites by means of 16 variables using the t-test and circular statistics. Results: Of 41 UTM square 10x10 km prospected, reproduction has been verified in 9, with 11 located breeding pairs. Potentially breeding pairs have been detected in other 6 squares and the species has been detected during the breeding season in other 13 square. In central Catalonia, Booted Eagles breeds significantly in places away from country houses. However, this species tolerates a more significant presence of paved and unpaved roads near its nesting area than would occur at random points. Birds nest in big trees (preferably Black Pine) of extensive, closed and shady woods, significantly orientated between 31.5°N to 45°N. Conclusions: In the area studied, the species settles down preferably far from the human settlement, although it perfectly tolerates the presence of highways and forest paths. Contrary to what happens in other Iberian areas, where the species breeds in solitary trees and in small groups of trees, in central Catalonia the Booted Eagle breeds in big trees of extensive, closed and shady forests of Black Pine, facing north. The orientation of the nest is probably influenced by the wind direction, the altitude and perhaps by the solar radiation.",Booted Eagle; forest management and nesting habitat,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1239.pdf,December 2005,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/522/articles/225-233/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PALMEIRIM,,"Aims: The feeding ecology of Dunlin Calidris alpina wintering in southern European wetlands is poorly known. The aim of this paper is to describe the diet, prey selection, foraging habitat selection, and feeding behaviour of wintering Dunlins, and interpret this information in the light of the current knowledge on the feeding ecology of this species. Location: The study was carried out in the sediment flats of the Tagus estuary, Portugal, which is the largest estuary in Iberia, and harbours large numbers of wintering waders. Methods: Diet of Dunlin was investigated using dropping analysis. Foraging habitat selection was studied using bird counts and behavioural observations in sectors located on different types of sediment. The abundance of invertebrates in the sediment was sampled to evaluate prey availability and to interpret patterns of habitat selection by the birds. Results: Scrobicularid bivalves and the gastropod Hydrobia ulvae were the most consumed prey items, followed by the isopod Cyathura carinata and insects. Prey species with higher biomass, such as Hediste diversicolor and Scrobicularid bivalves were preferred. The smallest and largest sizes of some important prey species were avoided. Dunlins showed a clear preference to forage in muddy, rather than sandy, sediments. Overall pecking rates were similar in all types of sediment, but deep probes were more frequent in softer mud. Conclusions: Some of the staple preys of Dunlin in Tagus estuary are also abundantly consumed in northern latitudes. However, other prey species important in northern Europe are here replaced by similar and locally common species. In the Tagus estuary, Dunlin feed upon a broad spectrum of invertebrate species, but show clear patterns of selection of prey species and sizes. Dunlin prefer to forage on muddy substrates, probably because their main prey are more abundant and accessible here than in harder, sandier, substrates.",Calidris alpina; diet; feeding behaviour; invertebrates; prey selection; sediment type; Tagus estuary,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1240.pdf,December 2005,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/522/articles/235-252/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Analysis by dissection was made of the main forelimb muscles related to flight: muscle (m.) pectoralis, m. supracoracoideus, m. deltoideus major, m. triceps brachii and m. biceps brachii. The gross morphology of these muscles was studied in 10 pairs (genera) of species using a phylogenetically-based method of comparison. Estimation was also made of the force these muscles are able to develop upon contraction and their mass was taken. Within each pair (genus), one species was migrant and the other sedentary. Results: Among species, none qualitative differences in muscles morphology were found. However, migrant species showed relatively stronger and heavier m. pectoralis than their sedentary counterpart, the rest of the muscles studied not differing either in their mass or in the force they develop upon contraction between these two groups of species. Conclusions: M. pectoralis is the main wing depressor. Modifications found in migrant species increase the force this muscle is able to develop upon contraction, they being interpreted as adaptive modifications in migrant species leading to a more efficient forward flight which is that needed for migrating.",Ecomorphology; forelimb; migration; morphology; myology; passerines,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1241.pdf,December 2005,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/522/articles/253-268/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

JARDINE,,"Aims: To make a comparative study of the flight and excitement calls of Crossbills Loxia curvirostra in the Mediterranean region. Given that different call types (distinguished by combinations of flight and excitement calls) are recognised within the nominate race in northern Europe, we expected that the subspecies endemic to the Mediterranean region would each have a different call type, whilst Pyrenean birds might share calls with one of the call types already described in northern Europe. Location: Calls of Crossbills were recorded in Mallorca, Cyprus and Morocco, where three Mediterranean subspecies of the Common Crossbill occur. Recordings were also made in the Pyrenées, inhabited by the nominate subspecies. Methods: Calls were recorded on a Sony Walkman Professional tape recorder using a Pro-sound directional microphone (model YU-36) or a parabolic reflector. The CANARY system was used to make sonograms. Results: Although different combinations of flight and excitement calls were detected, all four groups of crossbills shared either flight or excitement calls. In particular, the similarity between the flight and excitement calls of crossbills from Mallorca and the Pyrenées suggests that these populations may not be separate. Further, many of the calls of the Mediterranean crossbills were similar to calls of Scottish and Parrot Crossbills in Scotland, rather than Common Crossbills. One individual recorded in Mallorca had flight and excitement calls that matched a call type of the nominate race from northern Europe, confirming that some migrants reach the Mediterranean islands. Conclusions: The results followed our expectation that the endemic subspecies of Crossbills in the Mediterranean region each have different combinations of flight and excitement calls. However, the sharing of flight or excitement calls adds to the debate about the relations among Mediterranean crossbills and their relationship with crossbills on the Spanish mainland. Further, the similarity in calls between Mediterranean and north European pine crossbills supports the hypothesis based on fossil evidence that the pine-adapted crossbills may share a common ancestry.",Loxia curvirostra; Pinus; sonograms; vocalisations,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1242.pdf,December 2005,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/522/articles/269-278/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the period preceding pair formation (February 2003), the relationship was obtained between body size (represented by tarsus length) and an effective index of fat reserves (body mass x tarsus length-3) with tarsi fluctuating asymmetry, haematocrit, leukocyte index, heterophil/lymphocyte ratio and albumin/globulins ratio. Results: The extent of the fat reserves decreases during the autumn and winter. The heterophil/lymphocyte ratio was found to be significantly and positively related to body size, and negatively so to the fat index. In addition, the fat index was found to be significantly and negatively related to tarsi fluctuating asymmetry. Conclusions: The findings that preferred fatter males are more symmetrical, and that these fatter males, as well as those of smaller size, are healthier with respect to the heterophil/lymphocyte ratio point to the election of male mates, not only for the benefits derived from maintaining incubation, but also of good health.",body condition; Gallinula chloropus; mate choice; Moorhen,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1243.pdf,December 2005,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/522/articles/279-285/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AGUILAR; José VERDEJO,,"Aims: To apply modern habitat modelling techniques using generalized linear models approach to generate not only explicative but also predictive habitat suitability models. Ecological factors that could affect the species’ nesting habitat preferences at two spatial scales, one referred to the colony as a sampling unit and another trying to reflect the landscape level, had been underlined. Location: Castellón province, eastern Iberian Peninsula. Methods: Occupied and unoccupied cliffs and 10x10Km U. T. M. squares were compared using univariate tests. A generalized linear model, employing logistic regression, was applied to explain and predict the occurrence of Griffon Vultures at two spatial scales. In order to select the most parsimonious model amongst a set of logistic models built with different explanatory variables, the Akaike´s information criterion (AIC) was performed. With the aim of testing the predictive performance of the previously selected models, the threshold-independent Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) plot was computed. Results: 19 of 29 variables analyzed presented significant differences between occupied and unoccupied cliffs and between occupied and unoccupied squares. Colony parameters, climate, disturbance and vegetation variables, showed a good model performance in accordance with ROC plots and AUC. Despite geomorphological variables being significant on logistic model, model assessment techniques applied in this study suggested that they could not discriminate Griffon Vulture probability of occurrence by themselves. Trophic variables were not selected as good predictors by any method. Conclusions: Model selection is useful for making inferences from field data. When coupled with Geographic Information System (GIS), habitat models generated by logistic regression approach can aid to develop occurrence maps displaying suitable habitat for nesting. This new applied technique has a broad potential application in conservation biology and management.

At the same time other ecological aspects were studied, i. e. microhabitat selection and foraging behaviour. Location: Seven study areas located around the pine forest of Tenerife, Canary Islands. Methods: Point counts were used for censusing birds. Data were analysed with the DISTANCE software programs using an average detectability function. Microhabitat structure was characterized by measuring 11 variables in a 25m radius at each point. We used Poisson regression models to predict counts for Blue Chaffinch from habitat measurements. Repeated standardised focal samples were used to record the foraging behaviour of Blue Chaffinch (one record per bird). Differences in foraging behaviour were analysed by chi-square tests. Results: Based on the 370 point counts giving similar densities for the two main pine forest habitats for the species (6.7 birds/ha in the north vs. 6.5 birds/ha in the south). The density of thin pine trees best predicted Blue Chaffinch counts on the whole island. Chaffinch density increased significantly in the north of Tenerife as the shrub cover of Adenocarpus sp. increased and as the mean height of the shrub layer increased. Finches were observed foraging mainly for Myrica faya seeds during the non-breeding (winter) season and on open cones for their seeds of the Canary Pine trees (Pinus canariensis) during nesting (females searching on the needles during this time), at least on the eastern side of the island where the sample protocol was undertaken. Conclusions: This study justifies a forest management policy of selective clearing of heavily dense areas of pine trees in the north of Tenerife, where no undergrowth is present. Reafforestation campaigns in the south of this island should aim to plant with pine trees those areas which were historically dominated by pine trees.",Birds; Blue Chaffinch; Fingilla teydea teydea; population size; microhabitat selection; foraging behaviour,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1245.pdf,December 2005,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/522/articles/305-317/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Location: The study was carried out in the Duero Valley, confluence of Cega and Duero rivers (Valladolid, Spain). Methods: captures with mist nest, ringing and taking of data in hand. Results: high variations of body mass were observed in recoveries, with increments of 6.87 grams during the day and losses of 4.94 g. during the night. Body mass of birds captured in the dusk was larger than in the dawn both in adults (average = 9.85) and juvenile (6.65). The index means of fat found for each age and hour was 1.2 at the dawn and 2.2 at dusk for the juvenile, and 1.5 and 2.5 respectively for the adults. It was a high correlation between the body mass and the fat index on the captured birds. The Common sandpiper fattens a daily average of 1.93 grams, increasing their body mass in 5.04 grams among the first and last capture. Some individuals increase until 60% of body mass during their stay. The stragglers birds remain more time at the study area. It seems to exist a higher nutritious efficiency of adults regarding the younger that could explain the progressive delay in the migration of the younger birds. Conclusions: The species has a very active metabolism, with high variations of body mass along the day and high night losses. The results support the hypothesis that the adults travel quicker than the juvenile in autumn. This can be originated by a higher nutritious efficiency, a smaller energy expense or for the competitive domain of the adults. It is possible that the migration is slower in the coast, where the young birds prevail in the realized studies, than in the interior. Probably in the coast the adults use a similar strategy to the juvenile ones.",Actitis hypoleucos; autumn passage; body mass; Duero valley; fat; differential migration; gain of body mass; migratory strategies,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1246.pdf,December 2005,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/522/articles/319-331/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A literature review in search of a consensus,,Alejandro MARTÍNEZ-ABRAÍN; Daniel ORO,,"There is a sense of frustration among ornithologists, especially among those dealing with conservation biology, regarding the usefulness of research results for decision-making. Similar problems affect the social and behavioural human sciences and their failures have been partially linked with the strong dependence of data analysis on the statistical testing of null hypothesis. We review the literature on reasoning against and in favour of null hypothesis testing, in search of some consensus procedure for proper data analysis, so that knowledge acquisition is feasible and decision-making policies are useful. We conclude that a consensus on appropriate data analysis could be reached if we focus on precision of the estimates and biological relevance instead of on significance. This implies an important change in our way of thinking, promoting confidence intervals for the difference of effects rather than p-values. The alternative approach of Bayesian statistics can also be of great help in the decision-making process typical of applied ornithology as it provides a measure of the evidence of the effects and can solve complex models with straightforward procedures. We suggest that the slow progress of theory accumulation in ornithology and the low reliability of results for decision making may be due, to a large extent, to the way we analyze data rather than to the nature of the topics approached by ornithologists.",alternatives; Bayesian statistics; confidence intervals; decision-making; knowledge accumulation; null hypothesis; power analysis; P-values; significance testing,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1255.pdf,December 2005,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/522/articles/377-387/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: A total of 1,180 prey items was identified from the combined analysis of pellets and prey remains collected in nests and perches of the species. Results: Biases in diet results from the use of pellets (insects overrepresented) or remains (vertebrates, birds and mammals, overrepresented). Significant differences in the feeding of harriers between the two land-use systems were demonstrated. Hence, large insects (mainly grasshoppers) showed a higher importance in agricultural pseudosteppe areas than in pasture-lands dedicated to extensive livestock, with respect both the number of prey (82% vs. 67%) and prey weight (26% vs. 16%). On the contrary, in pasture-land areas birds and mammals contributed to a higher number of prey (32% vs. 18%) than in agrosystems, but this did not represented a higher relative importance in biomass (80% vs. 72%). Harriers take both larger and more diverse preys in pastures-lands than in agrosystems.

Methods: Spatial relationships between sheep flocks and Houbara flocks were explored and tested using the spatial point pattern analytical framework. Results: Significant mutually-exclusive distribution patterns between sheep and goat flocks and bustards were detected throughout the whole year.

An ex-ante assessment,,Diego LLUSIA; Juan J.

Methods: A literature review was made on these requirements, based on which 21 ""desirable agricultural practices"" were identified. National and regional legislative acts implementing schemes under the 2000-2006 programme as in December 2003 were then collected, and the degree to which these desirable practices had been included among the schemes´ commitments was determined. The percentage of included desirable practices was considered an indication of the schemes´ adequacy towards the conservation requirements of pseudo-steppe birds. Schemes were also assessed in regards to their provisions for spatially targeted implementation. Results and Conclusions: Only 71% of identified desirable practices are included as commitments to farmers at the national level. Implementation deficit at the regional level diminishes this figure at an average 39%, with extreme cases at 0 % and 67 %. Further, schemes´ implementation is generally not targeted to particular sites of special conservation interest, such as Special Protection Areas (Birds Directive). On the basis of encountered design deficiencies and limited implementation, it is concluded that limited effects in terms of pseudo-steppe birds´ conservation can be expected from current agri-environmental schemes in Spain. Further, it is argued that detected implementation deficits may be seriously impeding a needed learning-from-doing process in the agri-environment policy arena, an issue of capital importance in the actual context of the European Common Agricultural Policy.",pseudo-steppe birds; conservation; agri-environment policy; ex-ante assessment; Spain,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1221.pdf,June 2005,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/521/articles/31-42/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results: The probability of predation was unrelated to outer nest diameter nor was there any relationship between internal diameter and the presence of unhatched eggs. Wall thickness and nest mass declined as the season progressed but there was no relationship between these variables and the mean environmental temperature during either seven or four days preceding the start of nest building. Clutch size did not correlate with outer nest diameter nor with nest mass but was positively related to nest volume.

Ardeola,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/,2005,,Volume 52(1),,Fluctuations related to rainfall in richness and abundance of birds of steppic Mediterranean habitats,,Eduardo DE JUANA; Ángela M. GARCÍA,,"Aims: The existence of interannual variations in the richness and abundance of bird species breeding in pseudo-steppic Mediterranean areas is analysed and related to the important fluctuations that take place in rainfall, which in turn deeply influence vegetation growth. The hypothesis of food limitation as a key factor in determining population sizes, allows the prediction of the existence of positive correlations between these parameters. Location: The study was carried out in the Extremadura region, south-west Spain. Seven areas of pseudo-steppes were selected, characterized by large treeless plains devoted to un-irrigated cereal cultivations and/or extensive grazing grasslands. Climate is typically Mediterranean and semi-arid, with annual rainfall around 400-600 mm, mild and relatively wet winters, and very dry and hot summers. Methods: Bird communities were surveyed by means of point counts, placed along fixed routes which were repeated every year in the same spring dates (14 to 27 point counts in each locality). Surveys were conducted in five different years, three of them consecutive. Data regarding changes in rainfall were obtained from meteorological stations placed in or very close to the study areas. Results: Cumulative rainfall during the months preceding breeding bird censuses (January to April) showed significant inter-annual variations. Densities of several breeding bird species also exhibited important changes along the study period, especially noticeable among grassland or steppic species (those nesting in the ground), where they were statistically significant for most of the common species. Fluctuations among years of bird densities usually took place in parallel to those of rainfall. Average richness was positively correlated to rainfall in the whole of the breeding bird community, as well as in the steppic birds group, but it was not correlated to rainfall in the non-steppic birds group (species usually nesting in buildings or trees). Analysis of the variance by species allowed us to differentiate in the inter-annual variations the effects of years and localities. In only three steppic species there were significant changes mainly explained by differences between years and at the same time, showing a positive significant correlation with rainfall (Quail Coturnix coturnix, Fan-tailed Warbler Cisticola juncidis and Corn Bunting Emberiza calandra). On the other hand, there were species apparently not affected by rainfall, among them all or most belonging to the non-steppic group. Conclusions: The parallel and spatially synchronic fluctuations of cumulative rainfall, indices of vegetation growth, and densities of several grassland bird species, agree with a limiting role of the resources linked to vegetation, whose marked reduction during dry years would impose reductions in the population sizes of those species. Nevertheless, changes in rainfall and plant productivity do not affect many other bird species, among them all or most in the non-steppic group, making difficult to assume that the limiting factors are directly related to food (although insectivorous species may have fluctuated on average more than seed-eating species). An alternative or complementary explanation may link the decreases in abundances of certain species to the simplification taking place during dry years in the habitat structural complexity.",bird communities; Cisticola juncidis; climatic oscillations; Coturnix coturnix; Emberiza calandra; Extremadura; food resources; grassland birds; population dynamics; spatial synchrony,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1223.pdf,June 2005,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/521/articles/53-66/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MARTÍN; Carlos PALACÍN; Beatriz MARTÍN; Marina MAGAÑA,,"Aims: Between 2001 and 2004 the first comprehensive census of Great Bustards Otis tarda was carried out in Andalusia, southern Spain. This region holds one of the most endangered populations of the Iberian Peninsula. The aims were to establish the locations of current leks and the numbers of birds breeding at them, determine their age and sex structure and reproductive success, and discuss present and past population trends. These data are essential to plan the conservation of this threatened population. Results and Conclusions: The total estimated number of birds in the region was 338, distributed in 16 leks plus two breeding sites with only females. The species is today extinct in Almería, Granada, and Málaga. The current distribution is highly fragmented, with two main aggregations of three and five leks in the Guadalquivir valley, respectively close to Osuna, in Sevilla province, and at the border between the provinces Córdoba and Jaén. Another group of three leks is located in the northwest border of the region, separated from the rest by Sierra Morena mountain chain. These birds are perhaps demographically more related to the Bustards of Extremadura than to other leks in Andalusia. The Guadalquivir subpopulation is the remnant of a formerly much larger population, which has declined due to the high hunting pressure before the hunting ban in 1980, and to agriculture intensification during the last decades. Great Bustards survive today in suboptimal habitat, but could go through a slow extinction process in the future if habitat conditions are not improved. Man-induced mortality causes have also probably contributed to the extremely female-biased sex-ratio, with an estimated 3.28 females per male, and several leks with only 1-2 males with 4-17 females. Throughout the study period numbers of males and females increased in Osuna, and adult males decreased in Arahal, Gerena and Bujalance. These decreases are not compensated for by the remarkably low productivity (0.08 young per female in September, range of annual values 0.04-0.12). In conclusion, the small numbers of birds, fragmented distribution, extremely biased sex-ratio, high adult male mortality, and low productivity clearly reflect the poor conservation status and serious extinction risk of the Great Bustard population in Andalusia. Conservation efforts should be urgently directed towards improving habitat conditions, in order to increase current productivity values and decrease mortality through collision with powerlines.",Andalusia; Distribution; Great Bustard; Otis tarda,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1224.pdf,June 2005,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/521/articles/67-78/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ARHZAF; Driss AZIZI,,"Aims: Between 1999 and 2005 five spring censuses of the Great Bustard Otis tarda population in Morocco were carried out, one of which (2003) was finally discarded due to bad weather conditions. Some complementary, partial counts in autumn 2000, winter 2001-2002 and spring 2004 were also carried out. The aims were to survey new areas where occurrence of the species was suspected but not confirmed, re-evaluate all recently published counts, establish reliable productivity, sex-ratio, and age structure values, and assess the conservation status of this endangered population. Results and Conclusions: Seven leks were identified, two of which had not been described in earlier studies (Chekbouchan, Mrhitane). The total numbers of birds counted in spring varied between 70 and 84. Based on these, 80-113 birds were estimated in Morocco. The annual estimates of 99, 98, 90 and 80 birds, respectively for 1999, 2001, 2002 and 2005, suggested a decline in numbers throughout the study period, particularly at the two northern leks. Compared to the scarce data from previous decades, these counts suggest that the population has suffered a moderate decrease. The sex-ratio was extremely female-biased, with 3.9 observed and 4.1 estimated females per male. The age structure of the male population was remarkably young, with 23.5% immature males (range 11.1-33.3%), a higher proportion than that recorded in Iberian populations of the species. Average annual recruitment was 0.10 juvenile birds survived up to March from the previous breeding season, per adult female (range 0.045-0.178), a reasonable value compared to Iberian populations. These data suggest that Moroccan Great Bustards are subjected to high adult male mortality. This was corroborated with numerous well-documented cases of illegal hunting. Poaching was identified as the main current threat for the population, followed by collision with powerlines. It is suggested that poaching, and particularly male trophy hunting, has caused the decreases in numbers observed at some leks during the present study. Other threats include the foreseeable extension of the powerline network, and the agriculture intensification at current breeding areas. Immediate conservation actions are urgently required to save this extremely endangered population from extinction.",Distribution; Great Bustard; Morocco; Otis tarda; status,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1225.pdf,June 2005,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/521/articles/79-90/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Morocco, the Houbara Bustard mating strategy partially fulfills this definition. Display males are greatly separated and form so-called ""exploded-leks"" where females can forage or even nest, therefore failing to fulfil the third criteria of the lek definition. When leks contain critical resources for females, the strategy is a resource-based mating system. To verify the importance of resources in the Houbara mating system the breeding habitat use and selection of 7 females and 13 males was studied and compared to food resources availability (arthropod biomasses) and vegetation structure. The spatial relationship between female home-ranges, nests and leks was then studied. Results and Conclusions: Both sexes were significantly selective in comparison to habitat availability, but breeding habitat use significantly differed between sexes. Habitat preference and avoidance were not related to arthropod biomasses that appeared homogeneously distributed across habitats. Females brood preferentially in the reg with tall perennials that was not preferred by males. The percentage of overlapping between female breeding ranges and leks was low (21%) and 78% of nests were outside leks. Critical resources for females were not situated within leks.

GARCÍA; Juan MANRIQUE,,"Aims: To describe the variation in laying date, clutch size, egg volume and hatching asynchrony of four lark species (Skylark Alauda arvensis, Short-toed Lark Calandrella brachydactyla, Thekla Lark Galerida theklae and Lesser Short-toed Lark Calandrella rufescens) and at two different time scales: between years (large-scale variation), and within seasons (short-scale variation). Location: Two climatically contrasting Mediterranean areas: Layna, located in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula and with a continental Mediterranean climate, and Cabo de Gata, located in the south-western Iberian Peninsula and with a semi-arid climate. Breeding Skylarks and Short-toed Larks occur in Layna, whereas breeding Thekla Larks and Lesser Short-toed Larks occur in Cabo de Gata. Methods: During the study period between 1991-95 in Layna and between 1991-94 and 1996-97 in Cabo de Gata, searches were carried out for nests of the four species and laying date, measured egg-length and width, and hatching asynchrony recorded. Overall, 118 nests of Skylarks, 165 of Short-toed Larks, 334 of Thekla Larks and 259 of Lesser Short-toed Larks were studied. Between-year variations in breeding parameters were analysed with General Linear Models (GLM’s). To investigate the presence or absence of asynchronous hatching in relation to year, laying date and clutch size, bi and multinomial logistic regression models were fitted. Results: The breeding season in Cabo de Gata started earlier (60 days before) and was longer (15-25 days) than in Layna. The frequency distribution of laying dates was unimodal in all cases, with the exception of Lesser Short-toed Larks. Annual mean laying dates did not vary significantly among years in Layna, but the opposite was found in Cabo de Gata. However, mean laying dates of clutches from the 25 percentile show large between-year variations in all cases. Regarding the among-year variation in clutch size, all species studied except the Thekla Lark show a high degree of constancy in this parameter. The seasonal pattern of clutch size variation was similar in all species studied, with maximum clutch sizes on intermediate dates, and smaller early and late clutches. Mean clutch volume appears relatively constant in relation to annual variation in three of the species studied. Nevertheless, in Thekla Larks a significant inter-annual variation was observed in this breeding parameter. Finally, the incidence and/or the extent of hatching asynchrony are similar in all the species studied, increasing with clutch size and laying date. Conclusions: This study shows that the four lark species have different reproductive strategies which cannot be explained solely in terms of their body mass or biogeographical affinities. More studies are needed to evaluate how these factors could affect breeding success in larks in Mediterranean habitats and the implications on demography and population dynamics.",Alauda arvensis; Calandrella brachydactyla; Galerida theklae; Calandrella rufescens; larks; breeding period; mediterranean habitats; semi-arid climate; Iberian Peninsula,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1227.pdf,June 2005,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/521/articles/103-117/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ardeola,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/,2005,,Volume 52(1),,Open-habitat birds in recently burned areas: the role of the fire extent and species' habitat breadth,,Pere PONS; Josep M. BAS,,"Aims: To evaluate the occurrence of open-habitat and steppe-land bird species in Western Mediterranean burned areas and to assess the role of the extent and location of the fire on species richness and composition. At the species level, the relationship was explored between habitat breadth, distribution extent and the ability to occupy recently burned areas. Location: Iberia and Southern France Methods: Fieldwork and bibliography were assembled to obtain breeding bird inventories for 21 burned areas, mostly large wildfires (135- 23,800 ha). The sampling effort was standardized in relation to the area in the 11 fire locations surveyed using transects. Results: Single burned areas contained 0 to 15 open-habitat species (mean = 7.6), and in all the areas combined there were 22 species, including 17 with an unfavourable conservation status in Europe. The most frequent were Carduelis cannabina, Lullula arborea, Alectoris rufa, Oenanthe hispanica and Emberiza cia, but characteristic steppe-land birds such as O. leucura, Calandrella brachydactyla and C. rufescens also bred in particular burned areas. After controlling for the extent of the species range in the Spanish distribution Atlas, passerine occurrence in burned areas was positively related to the species' habitat breadth in a gradient of unburned habitats. Cluster analysis separated a species-poor group of fire locations from a species-rich group, and showed that some neighbouring areas had a similar species composition. However, there was no spatial autocorrelation between burned areas, and species composition was correlated with the fire extent (Mantel test). Species richness tended to increase with increasing fire area. From the regression equation 5, 9, 12-13 and 16-17 open-habitat species may be expected to occur in burned areas of 100, 1000, 10,000 and 100,000 ha, respectively. Conclusions: This study stresses the importance of biogeographical constraints on colonisation of new habitat patches created by disturbances. The extent of the fire rather than the proximity between burned areas influenced species richness and composition of open-habitat birds in recently burned areas. The best post-fire colonisers were generalists regarding habitat structure. The role of large wildfires in the conservation of threatened open-habitat birds seems to be significant and merits further study.",biogeography; colonisation; conservation; fire; passerines; species-area relationship; W Mediterranean,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1228.pdf,June 2005,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/521/articles/119-131/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GARCÍA DE LA MORENA; Manuel B. MORALES; Raúl GONZÁLEZ; María CASTAÑEDA,,"Aims: Home ranges, habitat use and selection of Dupont´s Lark Chersophilus duponti during the breeding and postbreeding periods were analysed using radiotagged birds. Location: Layna, central Spain (Soria, 41º05´N, 1º50´W; 1200 m a. s. l.). Methods: A total of 32 birds were radiotagged (22 males, 4 females and 6 juveniles) and monitored nearly daily from April 1st to September 1st. The following variables were measured (1) home ranges using the Minimum Convex Poligon, MCP, (2) core areas using the kernel 80 % density estimator, (3) the distance between successive daily locations, and (4) the degree of overlap of between individuals and periods in home ranges and core areas using Cole´s Index of Concordance. The use and selection of vegetation formations was studied on an individual basis comparing the percentage of bird locations and random points in each vegetation unit. The selection of habitat structure was measured along transects within the birds´ home ranges and compared to that measured along random transects outside home ranges. Results: Home ranges (mean, 8.1 ha), core areas (3.7 ha) and the distance between successive daily locations (around 120 m) did not differ between age-sex classes, or between periods in either sex. Juveniles showed larger core areas and movements than adults during the post-breeding period. Overlap between neighbouring males, as well as between juveniles and adults during the postbreeding period, was scarce in comparison with the overlap between members of the same pair or the overlap between the periods. Two males (9.1%) changed their home ranges during the breeding period, and the only fledgling captured near its nest stayed within paternal home range until at least 1 month old. The density in the study area was 1.0 males/10ha. Dupont´s Lark positively selected Genista pumila shrubs and negatively Genista scorpius shrubs, dry pastures and cereal fields. There were no differences between sexes, nor between periods among adults. Selection by juveniles differed from adult selection during the postbreeding period, using dry pastures more frequently than Genista pumila shrubs. Birds positively selected areas of high pillow-shape shrub cover at ground level, avoiding those of high tall-shrub cover at ground level. A binary logistic regression model including only pillow-shaped shrub cover at ground level as explanatory variable, correctly predicted 76% of home ranges, as confirmed by jacknife re-sampling estimation. Conclusions: Three main conclusions can be drawn from a conservation perspective: (1) the species´ territorial behaviour and strict habitat selection make it highly vulnerable to habitat changes, imposing careful habitat management; (2) management should also regard the marginal habitats used by juveniles; (3) the low density found in one of the best areas for the species in Iberia supports the low estimates of the Spanish population of the Dupont´s Lark made in previous studies.",Alaudidae; core areas; home range; Mediterranean; radio-tracking; Spain,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1229.pdf,June 2005,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/521/articles/133-146/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NORTE; Jaime A. RAMOS,,"Aims: The nest-site selection and breeding biology of Kentish Plover Charadrius alexandrinus were studied on sandy beaches of the Portuguese West coast. Methods: Nest-site characteristics were compared with those of random points and between successful and unsuccessful nests. Breeding parameters (timing of laying, nesting success and egg size) were examined on sandy beaches and these data combined with a literature review to provide a comparison of Kentish Plovers’ breeding parameters between natural (sandy beaches, saline lakes) and man-made coastal habitats (salinas and fish-farms). Results and Conclusions: Three temporal peaks of breeding activity were distinguished: end of April, mid May and end of June. Most nests were located less than 100 meters from the nearest active nest. The dimensions (breadth and volume) of the eggs from late clutches were significantly smaller than those from eggs of early and intermediate clutches. Nesting success was 32% (12.3% using the Mayfield method). There were significant differences in nesting success between the four studied beaches (56% of all clutches produced chicks in Gala while only 18% of all clutches produced chicks in Costinha). Despite the lower success of intermediate clutches no significant difference in nesting success was found between early, intermediate and late clutches. There was a higher probability of finding nest-sites near objects and in areas with a higher cover of sparse vegetation and objects than were random points. Successful nests were placed farther from the nearest mammal footprint, were closer to the nearest vehicle sandmark and had a lower cover of shells and pebbles than did unsuccessful nests. Nesting success was highly variable for both natural and man-made coastal habitats and affected mainly by predation and flooding. In terms of conservation it seems important to maintain habitat diversity for Kentish Plovers.",Breeding biology; breeding success; Charadrii; Charadrius alexandrinus; Kentish Plover; nest-site selection.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1187.pdf,December 2004,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/512/articles/255-268/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Bearded Vulture´s nesting sectors are vulnerable to kleptoparasitism (food is stored in a visible and predictable manner in nests, perching sites and ossuaries), and the Raven´s parasitic-predatory abilities are well known. How both species interact was examined by studying their behaviour during the nestling period and analysing the factors that affect this behaviour. Location: Central Pyrenees (Catalonia, NE Spain). Methods: The aggressive interspecific encounters in 10 nesting sites (area = 3750 km2) was quantified. The observations were carried out from locations where the nests, perching sites and ossuaries could be viewed simultaneously. The data were compared using non-parametric statistical tests. Results: Most of the attacks on the Ravens occurred from nests and the highest percentage of defensive behaviour in the Bearded Vultures was observed when the chicks were only a few days old. The Ravens preferred to attack when the Bearded Vultures were near the nests, whether the latter were carrying food or not. The Ravens were only relatively effective in their kleptoparasitic attempts when they attacked in a group at times when the Bearded Vultures were manipulating the food in open areas. Conclusions: The difference in size between both species, and the type of food affected the Ravens´parasitic efficiency. For the Bearded Vultures, the negative effects of coexisting with the Ravens are associated with the energetic costs derived from nest defence and the disturbance generated by the Ravens´kleptoparasitic attempts. Nevertheless, the Bearded Vultures´ defensive behaviour suggests that risks of predation exist, mainly during the initial stages of the breeding period, which is when the chicks are likely to be more vulnerable.",Bearded Vulture; Corvus corax; Gypaetus barbatus; interespecific interactions; kleptoparasitism; nest defence; predation risk; Raven.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1185.pdf,December 2004,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/512/articles/269-274/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the last decades, the winter distribution of the Bluethroat had been changing. This passerine winters mainly in Africa, although observations of birds wintering in Iberia have increased since the 1970s. We describe its migration and wintering patterns in central Spain, and try to understand the causes for this change in the wintering range. Location: The study was conducted at Las Minas Ringing Station (San Martín de la Vega, Madrid, 40.13ºN 6.32ºW). Methods: Data used was obtained at a constant ringing effort site in central Spain from 1995 to 2002. Captured birds were ringed, aged and sexed, and a variety of biometrics was taken. Results: Bluethroats captured in central Spain belonged to the cyanecula and namnetum subspecies, and come from central Europe. First birds arrived in late August or early September, and last birds left at the end of March. Part of the population annually winters in the area exhibiting similar patterns of arrival and departure dates throughout the years, and shows a high return rate. More males than females were captured, especially in winter. Wintering and non-wintering Bluethroat populations were similar in structure, biometrics and body condition, therefore wintering birds did not seem to be birds that for some reason (e. g. small size, bad body condition, inexperience), were unable to reach their usual wintering quarters in Africa. Conclusions: Wintering in Iberia could be advantageous because birds wintering closer to their breeding areas may arrive there earlier than those wintering in Africa. The results point to this hypothesis: the wintering population was comprised mainly of males, they arrived at the wintering area on a similar date each year, were in better body condition than other birds in winter and the return rate of the wintering population was high.",Bluethroat; central Spain; Luscinia svecica; migration; wintering,,,December 2004,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/512/articles/285-296/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Location: Alicante (dry cultivations) and Valencia (irrigated cultivations) in eastern Spain. Methods: Habitat composition around occupied and unoccupied territories in dry cultures and irrigated cultures was compared (n= 71, 1989-2000). This study also described differences in habitat composition between occupied and deserted territories after major habitat alterations started in 1996. Generalized Linear Models were used to examine patterns of habitat preference at three different spatial scales: nest site, home range and landscape. Results: The study population declined by 69% in both study areas. At the nest site scale, Barn Owls preferred undisturbed areas with high availability of cavities, mainly in man-made structures. At the home range and landscape scales, Barn Owls occupied undisturbed areas with a high availability of cavities and high percentages of edges and ditches. Territory desertion was prompted by the modernisation or disappearance of man-made structures, depletion of edges and ditches, expansion of the road network and persecution. Accordingly, the spatial distribution of territories in irrigated cultures changed from uniform to random after habitat alteration. The availability of cavities alone does not account for all of the explained deviance, i. e., Barn Owls occupy structurally complex landscapes. Conclusions: Compensation measures for habitat loss such as nest-box programs, usually proposed within the framework of environmental impact assessment, are discouraged unless habitat restoration and effective control of persecution are promoted first.",Agriculture abandonment; environmental impact assessment; strategic environmental assessment; persecution; nest-boxes; Barn Owl; Tyto alba,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1190.pdf,December 2004,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/512/articles/303-317/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Location: Data were obtained from a Purple Swamphen population in Alto Guadalquivir Natural Park (Jaén, Southern Spain) in two consequtive yeas (1990-1991). Methods: General and generalised linear models (GLM, GLZ) were used to account for relationships among variables and variance partitioning. Models included nested effects (eggs within nests), fixed effects (clutch size) and covariates (food availability, habitat structure, laying date and laying order, where appropriate). Clutch size and egg mass were used as dependent variables. Repeated measures ANOVA's were used for detailed analyses on the effect of laying order on egg mass variation. Results: Food availability around the nest was the most important determinant of clutch size and egg mass variation. A significant negative relationship between clutch size and egg mass was found, with larger clutches consisting of smaller eggs. Egg mass was also negatively affected by laying order. The slightest eggs in the clutch were more likely to fail hatching than earlier, larger ones, and they usually produced smaller chicks. Conclusions: Clutch size and egg mass variation seem to be highly influenced by environmental traits, particularly food sources, which may be a limiting factor in this wetland area compared to others in southern Spain.",Clutch size; egg mass; food availability; laying order; semi-precocial birds; territory quality,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1191.pdf,December 2004,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/512/articles/319-330/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results: Results indicate a total of 72 displaying males and an average breeding density of 0.7 displaying males´ km-2. Logistic regressions suggest a slight tendency for the selection of the inner part of the larger patches of potential habitat. Variables related with soil constraints are likely to be important. The interpolated Ordinary Kriging models indicate a good agreement with the field data.

More juveniles than adults were captured both during the migratory passages and during the winter. A similar proportion of males and females were captured during both passages, while males were more abundant during most of the wintering period. We found no differences in dates of passage between age classes or sexes. Conclusions: We described for the first time in Spain the phenology of both post- and prenuptial migratory passages and wintering of Blackcaps at a particular site during several years. Data presented here, along with other published studies, suggest the existence of differential migration between sexes. Females might winter at lower latitudes than males.",Blackcap; constant effort site; differential migration; postnuptial migration; prenuptial migration; Sylvia atricapilla; wintering,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1193.pdf,December 2004,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/512/articles/345-355/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several breeding and individual traits have been found to be related to CMI. However, it is not known how consistent these relationships are over the years. A four year study was conducted on the CMI response of White Stork Ciconia ciconia nestlings to evaluate this point. Location: Dehesa de Abajo, Puebla del Río, Sevilla, España. Methods: T-cell mediated immunity was measured by the PHA skin-testing technique in 1999, 2001, 2002, and 2003, as well as seven parental or individual variables for each nestling: laying date, clutch size, brood size, sex, age, brood hierarchy, and body condition. Results: The relationship between CMI and individual traits over the years depended on the studied variable. Some of them, when significantly related, showed a consistent relationship (e. g. body condition), while others did not have any relationship (e. g. age) or even contrary trends (laying date) depending on the year.

Location: Benidorm Island (eastern Spain, Mediterranean Iberian coast) and Vizcaya (northern Spain, Atlantic Iberian coast). Methods: Birds were caught with mist-nests set in breeding colonies and the state of flight feathers was scored. Primary, secondary and tail moult scores and the degree of moult asymmetry and an index of raggedness were calculated. Results: Moult in the primaries was ascendant, whereas in the secondaries it progressed from three different loci, and was irregular in the tail. During the breeding season, the level of raggedness was higher in the primaries than in the secondaries or the tail, but primary moult was significantly more symmetrical than in any of the other feather tracts. Primary moult started on average in late June in Benidorm, and in late July in Vizcaya. Secondary and tail moult in Benidorm started on average a month after onset of primary moult. Conclusions: Average onset of primary moult differed among areas, being earlier in southern than in northern areas. These different patterns of moult among areas are probably due to differences in breeding phenology.",Atlantic; European Storm-petrel; Hydrobates pelagicus; Mediterranean; moult; phenology,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1197.pdf,December 2004,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/512/articles/365-373/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Tubes containing feathers from nine bird species and containing three different pigments or no pigments were inoculated with bacteria (Bacillus licheniformis isolated from soil) and incubated at 37°C during eight days. Feather damage was monitored daily. Results and Conclusions: At the end of the experiment nearly all feathers were degraded to dust or fibres. However, melanin-containing feathers suffered from earlier bacterial damage than carotenoid-containing feathers or unpigmented feathers. The feathers last showing signs of bacterial damage were those of a parakeet that contained an unknown green pigment. The pigmentation of a feather, and thus its colour, may determine its susceptibility to bacterial degradation. Therefore if feather degrading bacteria could grow on free-ranging birds, they could play an unsuspected role on the evolution of bird plumage colouration.",Bacillus licheniformis; evolution of bird colour; feather-degrading bacteria; plumage colouration; soil bacteria,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1198.pdf,December 2004,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/512/articles/375-383/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Location: An area of over 2,100 km2 located in the province of Toledo, central Spain. Methods: 17 habitat variables were measured around 100 nests that were occupied between 1999 and 2003 and around 100 random points at four spatial scales (circular areas of 250, 500, 1000 and 1,500 m of radius). The range of spatial scales was established on the basis of the observed high density of Eagle Owl nests in the study area, the second highest reported to date. Habitat features of occupied and random areas were compared by means of logistic regressions for each spatial scale. The possible effect of the spatial autocorrelation was assessed using as additional predictors all the terms of a cubic equation defined by the coordinates of the sampling points. Results: Topographic irregularity and distance to the nearest stream were included into the models at all scales as the main predictors of the presence of Eagle Owl nests, classifying a high percentage of both random and occupied points. Percent correct classification of the models did not change across scales. Positive selection of areas with irregular topography and close to streams can be interpreted as due either to a choice of protected areas for nest location and/or of areas with high prey availability. At the 500 meters of radius scale the model included marginally the positive selection of areas with high covers of dehesa, a variable that may be interpreted in the same way that the selection for the two main predictors. Two terms (X and Y2) of the cubic equation witch defined the spatial distribution of the nest and random points entered into all the models as relevant factors. Conclusion: No hierarchical patterns of habitat preference were detected, contrasting with results from a previous study carried out in an area of lower rabbit abundance (Martínez et al., 2003a). This result may be related to the high abundance of rabbits in central Spain, witch would have lead to a preference for good nesting places rather than for areas with higher than average prey abundance. Methodological effects cannot be ruled out, however, in either this comparison or in multiscale habitat preference studies in general. Independent data on the foraging behavior of the involved species and/or on the fitness consequences of habitat selection would be necessary to ascertain whether results from multiscale studies truly reflect underlying biological processes (and what processes) or are biased by the parameter values of the modeling approach.",Bubo bubo; Eagle Owl; habitat preferences; land uses; multiple spatial scales; prey abundance; Spain; topography,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1199.pdf,December 2004,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/512/articles/385-394/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main aim of this paper is to test whether human disturbances in areas surrounding mature woodland patches affect more than habitat structure and composition a core population of this species in southwestern Asturias. Locality: The Natural Reserve of Muniellos (Asturias, NW Spain). Methods: In order to characterize currently occupied leks vs. random points and abandoned vs. occupied leks, we ran univariate (U-test) and multivariate (generalised additive models GAM) analyses, evaluating habitat features and human disturbances independently. Results and Conclusions: GAM models based on disturbances were more discriminative than habitat pattern-composition models; similarly, models based on random points classified better the data than occupied vs. abandoned models. In all cases, models were highly accurate and relatively complex. Places selected by males as display areas were located at the core of larger patches of woodland exhibiting a higher relative richness of woodland types, at higher altitude and further from rivers than random points. These suitable areas supported less human disturbances, as they were sited farer from roads, paths, houses and recurrently burned areas than random points. Capercaillie disappeared from leks situated in rolling hills, at lower altitude, nearer to ""pre-woodlands"", under shrubs and pine forests.

Location: Pitarque (Teruel) Methods: The breeding biology of the Magpie was analysed in 40 nests found in the study area by regular nest searching during the breeding seasons of 1994 and 1995. The reproductive success was related with the following variables: year, nest height, nest type in relation to the vegetal structure where the nest was built, laying date, clutch size, fledgling number, or type of nest (domed or undomed). Results: The population size oscillated between 33-41 individuals. Magpies started their breeding season in April with a mean clutch size of 6.8 eggs. Clutch size showed a negative and linear relationship with laying date. Mean hatching success was 57%, mean fledging success was 47% and mean breeding success was 27%. This population produced 1.84 chicks per breeding pair and 4.18 chicks per successful pair. Fifty-five percent of nests failed completely. Predation, hatching failure and desertion were the main causes of breeding failure (27%, 19% y 16%, respectively, according to total number of eggs). Conclusions: The breeding success of Magpies in the study area did not differ between domed and undomed nests.

Results: Breeding success and productivity were lower for pairs coexisting alternatively with Ravens or climbers, compared to undisturbed pairs. In addition, pairs settled at cliffs simultaneously occupied by Ravens and frequented by climbers did not fledge any young, suggesting that Raven predation on Peregrine eggs/chicks may be predisposed by human disturbance.

PLEGUEZUELOS,,"In the last two decades, the Bonelli´s Eagle had suffered one of the most severe population declines in Spain. This paper reviews the results of the studies on conservation biology of the Bonelli´s eagle Spanish populations and synthesises the management implications for the recovery and conservation of the species which can be extracted from them, in order to make them accessible to regional and national wildlife agencies. From that compilation, it is concluded that the following actions must be undertaken: i) Adult mortality need to be reduced, mainly by mitigating electrocution and eliminating direct persecution, both near the nesting-site and within the full home range area. This involves close partnership and collaboration between administrations, power companies, hunters, and pigeon fanciers. ii) In Spain, the Bonelli´s eagle is a mainly cliff-nesting raptor; therefore, the preservation of occupied and unoccupied nest-cliffs free from human disturbances is essential to avoid territory abandonment, decrease adult mortality, and maintain a high breeding success. Particular attention must be given to pairs breeding on low or accessible cliffs, or those with no alternative nest-cliffs available. These areas must be kept free from infrastructures and human presence. iii) To locate the settlement areas of juvenile individuals in each region, to ensure the correct population dynamics and conservation of the Spanish Bonelli´s Eagle population. In this way, it is necessary to minimise non-territorial eagle mortality (which is mainly caused by electrocution and direct persecution), and to implement sensible hunting management practices. iv) Increasing prey availability in breeding territories is necessary in populations where prey scarcity is limiting breeding success. It would be a suitable measure for northern Spanish populations, avoiding extensive forest plantations and favouring the presence of open lands in territories, through the promotion of traditional land uses and sensible game management.",Bonelli’s eagle; conservation biology; management implications; Spain,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1209.pdf,December 2004,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/512/articles/461-470/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, moult-breeding overlaps are especially frequent in the tropics, a fact which has been related to protracted breeding seasons and small clutches linked to high nest predation. Here, a new hypothesis explaining the high incidence of moult-breeding overlaps and low fecundity in tropical birds is proposed. Parasites and pathogens of birds may be more prevalent in the tropics than in temperate regions, requiring a higher level of immune responsiveness. There is observational and experimental evidence that moult interferes with immunity, and that the induction of an immune response delays the initiation of postnuptial moult. To avoid this conflict between a necessarily high preparedness of the immune system and plumage renewal, moult would have to be slowed down. Protracted moult processes would imply a high incidence of moult-breeding overlap. This, in turn, would reduce resources necessary for reproduction, leading to small clutches. Immunity and moult would limit fecundity in tropical birds.",Clutch size; immunity; life history trade-offs; moult-breeding overlap; tropics,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1210.pdf,December 2004,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/512/articles/471-476/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: The whole issues published by both Ardeola and Ibis were reviewed. The data base of ISI Web of Science was used to look for papers published in ornithology by Spanish authors as well. Results and Conclusions: The results show an increase in both the number of papers (797) and the number of authors (1,365) publishing in Ardeola over the last 50 years (Fig. 2 and 3). A 13.11% of authors were foreign researchers. The research topics most investigated were biogeography, reproduction, diet/trophic ecology and migration (Fig. 1). The number of papers devoted to biogeography and taxonomy decreased (Fig. 14 and 15), while those devoted to migration (Fig. 16), genetics and pollution did not show any temporal trend. The remaining research topics showed an increase during these 50 years. The comparison with Ibis shows that this journal published more papers than Ardeola. After correction for this factor, more papers were published in Ibis in relation to reproduction (Fig. 5), population dynamics (Fig. 7), morphology (Fig. 10), taxonomy (Fig. 15) and behaviour (Fig. 13). However, more papers were published in Ardeola dealing with biogeography (Fig. 14) and conservation (Fig. 8). The comparison with papers published by Spanish authors in journals covered by ISI shows that Spanish ornithologists preferred Ardeola to publish their papers on migration (Fig. 1). They did not show any preference in relation to publication of studies dealing with habitat selection or diet/trophic ecology, while they preferred to publish the papers of the remaining topics in SCI journals (Fig. 1). The analysis of the preferences of research by avian orders and families shows that paseriforms, charadriforms and raptors focused the attention of Spanish ornithologists (Fig. 17). Within paseriforms, sylvids, corvids, parids, muscicapids, and fringilids were the families most studied (Fig. 18).",Ardeola; bibliometry; history of science; Ibis; ornithology; publication bias; research topics; SCI; Spain; sociology of science.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/552.pdf,June 2004,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/511/articles/3-18/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: I have made a thorough search of the relevant literature, and among the available sources have made especial use of two lists of endangered birds, published in 1955 and 1956, and three official red data books, from 1986, 1992 and 2003. For each threatened species short information is given on population estimates and trends, and eventually, on range trends. Results: Numbers of threatened species and average levels of the threat categories went down between 1992 and 2003, partly as a result of the application at national levels of the IUCN criteria for assigning threat categories. In the whole period 1954-2004 a general improvement in the situation of endangered species is also apparent. However, this improvement greatly varies among the different ecological groupings of birds that may be recognised, being good as a rule among waterbirds, raptors and woodland birds, and bad among birds of pseudosteppes and other agricultural environments. Conclusions: The important changes that have taken place in Spain regarding hunting and conservation laws, protected areas network, and general attitude of citizens towards nature, may account for much of the general improvement recorded so far, but certain conservation problems arising from modern changes in the rural environment, especially in agriculture and forestry, affect in different ways the different species assemblages. The positive trends observed in woodland birds and the negative ones in birds depending on agriculture are broadly coincident with those reported from other Western European countries. The apparent drawback in the situation of seabirds is partly related to a rising in the available information, since knowledge on this group was rather scanty until the 1980's. Future priorities in bird conservation in Spain should include fighting against the illegal use of poisons for predator control, moving forward in the reform of the CAP with environmental criteria, and keeping or increasing the current bird census and monitoring efforts.",Birds; conservation; raptors; red data books; seabirds; Spain; status; steppe birds; waterbirds; woodland birds.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/553.pdf,June 2004,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/511/articles/19-50/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is some evidence that studies of Mediterranean populations may bridge the life history gap between tropical and north temperate populations. Fecundity seems to be lower in the Mediterranean than farther north, while adult survival could be higher due to benign winter climates or shorter migration routes. Multi-broodedness may be more common and lead to reduced clutch sizes. Nest predation may also be higher and more similar to the tropics in the Mediterranean. Parasites may not be a secondary determinant of breeding success and adult survival, but exert a relentless selective pressure on breeding adaptations of Mediterranean birds. Thermal constraints imposed by hot and dry summers may affect the duration of breeding seasons, the number of broods and hatching asynchrony through effects of temperature at laying on egg viability. Spanish studies have revealed bizarre male displays of vigour as well as geographic variation in the sexual implications of some ornaments studied farther north. Parasite-mediated sexual selection could be stronger in Mediterranean populations. Spanish researchers have revealed a new model system in the study of brood parasitism, which has contributed an improved understanding about the intricacies of host-parasite behavioural interactions and about the speed and scale of evolutionary arm-races.",Breeding biology; brood parasitism; climate; geography; latitude; life history; Mediterranean; parasites; sexual selection; Spain.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/554.pdf,June 2004,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/511/articles/51-70/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ardeola,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/,2004,,Volume 51(1),,Spanish research on avian migration: historical trajectory and future perspectives,,Javier PÉREZ-TRIS; TomÁs SANTOS,,"Aim: To value the importance of research on avian migration for the development and current status of Spanish ornithology. Results and Conclusions: Avian migration has always been an outstanding field in ornithology. This assertion is particularly true in Spain, as we illustrate here by discussing the contribution of migration research to both the scientific and historical development of Spanish ornithology. After all, the Iberian Peninsula is one of the best scenarios for the study of migration in Europe (Fig. 1), as it forms natural bridges for birds migrating between Europe and Africa and between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. As well, it is one of the main wintering grounds for European birds in the Mediterranean area. Migration ecology experienced a relatively early development in Spain, compared to other fields in ornithology. Short after the foundation of the Spanish Ornithological Society (SEO) in 1954, migration surveys often triggered pioneering attempts to build up long-term research programs (Table 1). Thus, massive ringing campaigns were among the very first scientific activities organised by SEO, and became formally regularised with the creation of the Bird Migration Centre (CMA) in 1957, one of the first successful attempts to institutionalize ornithological research in Spain. Later on, these activities acquired international relevance with the publication of their results in international meetings, and the participation of the CMA in the foundation of EURING. These facts, together with the creation of the Spanish Group of Raptor Migration (GEMRA) for monitoring the passage of soaring birds across the Strait of Gibraltar, were fundamental pieces in the training of a whole generation of Spanish ornithologists. Perhaps migration gained a prominent position relative to other fields in Spain owing to the personal interests of Francisco Bernis, who was responsible, directly or indirectly, of most of the achievements of a newly born Spanish ornithology (from the 1940´s to the late 1970´s). Leading the foundation of SEO, he published a profuse collection of seminal reports, monographs and handbooks, which pushed forward several fields of ornithology in Spain, but paid special attention to migration. Such interests could be motivated by a late advent of Spanish ornithological research in the international framework: the advantages of the Iberian Peninsula for the study of migration, and the still poor knowledge of the ecological processes occurring south of the scientifically leading countries (central and northern Europe), offered a good opportunity for Bernis´school to make a contribution of general relevance to the scientific community. Thus, the analysis of ringing recoveries in Spain of birds ringed in Europe, the ecological and evolutionary interpretation of wintering in the Mediterranean (Table 1), or the study of visible migration in Gibraltar (Fig. 2) were all major contributions of F. Bernis to the growth and international diffusion of Spanish ornithology. This contribution of migration studies to the maturation of Spanish ornithology is also reflected by nearly as many publications on migration in Ardeola, the Spanish ornithological journal, as there were derived from faunistic research (which traditionally dominated the contents of the journal; Fig. 3). Today, Spanish ornithology has reached a high average standard, being recognised as internationally influential. As a consequence, the research published in Ardeola seeks to broaden its potential readership (using more frequently the English language) and has become increasingly professionalized (Fig. 4). This healthiness of Spanish ornithology in general is also perceived in migration research (Fig. 4). Spanish researchers and amateurs (particularly ringers) are keen to enrol in international co-operative projects, being institutionally supported by the Spanish ringing scheme (Migratory Species Office, Ministry of Environment). As an immediate benefit, this should help us to put our knowledge on migration through and to the Iberian Peninsula in a broader ecological and geographic context. Besides, Spanish researchers are taking advantage of excellent chances to study the ecological and evolutionary implications of migration and wintering in the Mediterranean. Future research should contribute to fulfil the social demand for studies that may help us to foresee the consequences of processes such as climate change or habitat destruction, a research front that both Spanish authorities and scientists have a decisive obligation to push forward.",Avian migration; bird wintering; development of science; Spanish ornithology.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/555.pdf,June 2004,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/511/articles/71-89/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this paper is to review the different adaptations and strategies of birds for surviving the winter, with a special emphasis on the peninsular winter quarters, one of the most suitable geographic areas for the reception of a very important contingent of birds from the western Palaearctic. This suitability is the result of its southern geographic situation which provides a milder climate, of the canalising of the main presaharian migratory routes, and of its topographic variety, diverse landscape and heterogeneity of environments. Results and Conclusions: Key variables explaining the winter distribution of birds in Iberian Peninsula are altitude, vegetation structure and geographic location. Parameters describing land bird communities (density, richness and diversity) can equally be predicted by the same variables. Aquatic environments are affected by the basin in which they are located and by rainfall patterns, which in turn determine the levels of grouping of the different contingents of birds. In order to offset the higher energetic requirements of winter, birds have developed different adaptations: increase the size of fat reserves, store food, increase metabolic rate, and develop different specialized behaviours. The Iberian Peninsula offers a wide range of trophic possibilities: herbs, seeds, bulbs, tubers and rhizomes; fruits, berries and acorns; pine seeds and other arboreal food resources, and invertebrates. In aquatic environments, there are important vegetable resources, aquatic invertebrates and fishes. Finally, the same wintering birds may appear as an important food resource for raptors. Human life and its consequences (garbage and rubbish dumps, fish farms, etc.) have favoured changes in the feeding habits of several species. The exploitation of all these natural resources may give rise to different patterns of spatial use. One of the behavioural strategies most common during winter is the aggregation of individuals in flocks, albeit that some species may hold territorial patterns. Winter flocking entails different costs and benefits, which may be compensated by different strategies such as the formation of heterospecific groups, communal roosting, the establishment of social hierarchies, or the share-out of space by the different classes. Wintering contingents may fluctuate greatly from year to year because of phenomena such as thermal movements, irruptions and altitudinal movements. Winter may have important consequences on the evolutionary patterns of different species, either because some species may pair in this period, or because of the strong selection pressures exerted on them because of the harder weather conditions. Therefore, the consequences of what may happen in winter do not only affect this season, and its study may be of great relevance to the understanding of the whole natural and life history of the different species.",Winter; review; survival; adaptations; Iberian Peninsula.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/557.pdf,June 2004,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/511/articles/133-168/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Location: Southwestern Andalusia (southern Spain). Methods: In two breeding seasons the size, fluctuating asymmetry and extent of abrasion of the white terminal and black subterminal markings of male and female Rufous Bush Chats were compared until the end of reproduction. Results: A positive relationship was found in males between the size of their white terminal markings and reproductive success and a negative one between the size of their black subterminal markings and the rate of nest depredation. The size of the white patches was positively related within pairs. Only the size of the white terminal markings is notably reduced over the breeding season. Conclusions: Since most of the abraded white markings are beyond the point of the maximum width of the tail, the hypothesis is offered of an adaptive reduction of its dragging effect during the birds´ trans-Saharan late-summer southward migration. The black subterminal markings, protected by melanin against abrasion, may function fixing a limit to erosion.",Abrasion; Cercotrichas galactotes; migration; reproduction; Rufous Bush Chat; visual pattern.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/558.pdf,June 2004,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/511/articles/169-175/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FARGALLO,,"Aims: Geographical variation in laying date, clutch size and proportion of second clutches was studied in the Blue Tit Parus caeruleus in order to test current predictions about latitudinal trends of these reproductive traits. The effects of latitude, altitude, habitat type (deciduous, evergreen and mixed) and year of study were taken into account. Location: Data were obtained from 87 populations of the western Palaearctic along a latitudinal range of 27 degrees (33 to 60°N). Methods: General Linear Models (GLM) were performed on mean laying date, clutch size and proportion of second clutches of Blue Tit populations. Habitat type was included as a factor and the rest of variables as covariates. Results: Laying date was later in evergreen than in deciduous habitats, was positively correlated with altitude and showed a quadratic relationship with latitude. Blue Tits laid smaller clutch sizes in evergreen habitats compared with mixed or deciduous habitats. Clutch size was negatively correlated with altitude. The variation of clutch size on latitude was curvilinear. The proportion of second clutches was higher in mixed and deciduous than in evergreen habitats and its variation along the latitudinal cline also was better fitted to a quadratic than to a linear model. Conclusions: The latitudinal variation found in all these life history traits can not be only explained by classical hypotheses about latitudinal reproductive variation. As recent studies have shown, factors other than daylength, seasonality of resources and predation appear to operate in the determination of the reproductive parameters of passerine birds in a geographic context. Mixed forests appear to be the habitat where Blue Tits are more productive (large clutch sizes and high proportion of second breeding attempts). Habitat quality associated with the position (peripheral and central) of the distribution of a bird species in combination with other factors, namely ambient temperature and energy requirements, probably contribute to explain the curvilinear pattern found in reproductive traits of this species.",Laying date; clutch size; second clutches; latitude; altitude; habitat; Parus caeruleus.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/559.pdf,June 2004,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/511/articles/177-190/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GREEN; Cristina FUENTES; Manuel VÁZQUEZ; Covadonga VIEDMA; Natalia RAMÓN,,"Aims: To design methods to mark Marbled Teal Marmaronetta angustirostris, to test these methods in captive conditions and to apply them in field research in Spain. Location: Marked birds were released at El Hondo, Valencian community (eastern Spain) and Doñana (south-west Spain). Captive trials were conducted at nearby recovery centres. Methods: Colour and Darvic rings, nasal markers and wing tags were tested in captivity. Various designs of wing (patagial) tags varying in shape, size, nature of the code and attachment methods were also tested. Nasal markers were rejected after most fell off within a month in captivity. The other methods were used to mark birds that were released into El Hondo (following their rescue when they became trapped in an irrigation channel) or Doñana. Results: PVC colour rings stuck with superglue often dropped off within months, probably owing to the high temperatures. Especially designed Darvic rings with two digit alphanumeric codes were used, but these were rarely legible in the field. Initially a wider wing tag was used to mark 52 birds released in 1996, after testing with pinioned birds in captivity. It was then discovered that these tags caused feather wear on the opposing wing in full-winged birds, owing to the spinning of the tags during wing flapping. A narrower tag that greatly reduced this problem was developed and it was used to mark 288 birds released in 1997-1999. Observations of marked birds showed that most birds released at El Hondo remained there, although some were observed at Albufera de Valencia and Marjal del Moro. One bird was also recovered from Algeria. No birds released at El Hondo were recorded in Doñana, although one bird tagged in Doñana was observed at El Hondo. Tagged females in their first and second years were observed with broods, providing the first breeding observations for Marbled Teal of known age in the wild. Conclusions: Wing tags provided much more data than rings, but there were major problems of tag loss, poor visibility and feather wear. They are most appropriate for intensive studies in the first few months after marking, and are not suitable for general use in this threatened species. El Hondo is likely to be the source for the recent expansion of Marbled Teal into Albufera de Valencia, Marjal del Moro and other valencian breeding sites.

Location: The study was carried out from material collected in the river Miño estuary, Pontevedra, Northwest of the Iberian Peninsula. Methods: Information from the analysis of 343 droppings of Common Sandpiper collected during winter (October-February) is examined, tidal variation having taken into account. Prey selection has been studied (prey size and taxonomic selections) contrasting relative abundances from diet and substrate samples. Results: During the winter the diet of this wader species was mainly composed of three marine invertebrates, the amphipod Talitrus saltator (46.9%), the polychaete Nereis diversicolor (39.0%) and the decapod Carcinus maenas (6.3%). Polychaetes and decapods were mainly consumed during low tide periods and sandhoppers consumption corresponded to high tide periods. Contrary to the breeding or migratory seasons, insects were little represented in the diet. Common Sandpiper carried out size and species selection. Although species-specific selection was not remarkable, some grade of selection was detected towards Nereis diversicolor and Talitrus saltator as all other invertebrates were rejected. Carcinus maenas was positively selected, mainly small sized individuals (juveniles). In energetic terms, such selection is conducted towards the consumption of prey with greater profitability.

In this paper, we suggest that extant hypotheses are not mutually exclusive and may act simultaneously at different hierarchical levels.

Specifically, variations were tested taking into consideration the configuration of the visiting assemblages, visit frequency, amount of fruit consumed per visit, and methods of taking the fruits. Location: A 1 km<sup>2</sup> plot situated in the Torío river valley (900-1000 m a. s. l.), León province, NW Spain. Methods: Four plants with a maximum distance of 0.5 km between them situated in different microhabitats were used to study fruit consumption. The sampling unit was the feeding visit. The number of fruits eaten by each bird during each feeding visit and the method of taking the fruit were also recorded. The persistence of ripe fruit in all the plant species with fleshy fruits was checked weekly, and data was obtained on the seasonal availability of insects and other invertebrates. Bibliography was consulted for quantitative data on fleshy fruit availability and bird density in the area during the study period. The statistical analyses included the chi-square association test (?2), Poisson rates test (z), t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and Kruskal-Wallis test (K). Results: Considering the overall data (330 feeding visits), the species that most frequented the Spindles were the Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla (40.6%), Robin Erithacus rubecula (33.9%), and Song Thrush Turdus philomelos (13.6%). Significant differences in the visiting assemblages were recorded among the shrubs. The larger bird species consumed significantly more fruits per feeding visit than the smaller ones (Song Thrush: 11.9 fruits/visit, n = 45 visits; Blackcap: 4.2, n = 134; Robin: 3.0, n = 112). The amount of fruits eaten by some species per visit and the removal method used varied significantly among plants and temporally. Conclusions: Spatio-temporal changes were probably related to the characteristics of each microhabitat, plant physionomy, bird movements, and temporal changes in food accessibility and energy demand. The variations observed in the frugivorous avian assemblages within both bird species and species groups (disperser and non-disperser), though the latter differences were subtle and non-significant, could affect Spindle local demography.",Birds; Euonymus europaeus; foraging methods; frugivory; fruit removal; spatio-temporal variations; Spindle,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/531.pdf,December 2003,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/502/articles/171-180/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Central Catalonia and Tiétar valley reproductive parameters were statistical compared by Student t test. Central Catalonia laying dates was correlated with mean rainfall and number of rainy days during pre-laying period and reproductive parameters (clutch size, hatchlings and mortality) with meteorological variables (mean rainfall and rainy days number) during all reproductive phases. Results: For central Catalonia population no relationships were found between laying date and rainfall during pre-laying period. No differences were found for all studied reproduction parameters related with weather in several reproduction phases. A comparison of these results showed a higher productivity as Tiétar valley population (central Spain). Conclusions: The higher breeding success of central Catalonia population than Tiétar valley population is probably due that Booted Eagle is density-dependent.

Location: Study area was located at South-eastern Madrid (600 m a. s. l.), in Central Spain. Methods: The area was surveyed between early December 1999 and late November 2000 to estimate monthly population of Storks presents at the study area. Twelve different power line sections and 129 steel power poles were surveyed monthly to study mortality by collision and electrocution. To control for underestimated collisioned and electrocuted casualties we calculated correction index. Correlation analysis, chi-square test, principal components analysis and logistic regression were used to test that 1) the mortality at power lines was related with population size in the area; 2) there are differences among mortality by lines type and poles type; 3) mortality by collision was related with environmental variables around power lines; and 4) environmental parameters influences electrocution risk on pylons. Results: We found that ca. 1% present population during postbreeding migration died on powerlines and 7% population did during preebreeding migration and wintering season. Deaths were nearly anecdotal during breeding season. Collision with wires and electrocution on pylons were both associated with rubbish dumps selection as foraging habitat. Annual mortality rates of collision (3.9 birds/km) and electrocution (0.39 birds/pylon) were the highest rates never found in Spain.

Location: The study was carried out in the urban and rural landscape of the city of Valencia (Spain). Methods: 197 squares (700 x 700 m) were surveyed in the breeding and wintering seasons of years 1997 and 1998. A monthly survey of 130 urban parks was also carried out in 1999. Relationship between number of introduced bird species and their abundance, landscape and habitat characteristics of tetrad squares and urban parks were analysed. Results: 23 introduced bird species have been recorded in Valencia, 56% of them belonging to Psittacidae Family. Most of the records belong to three breeding species, Ring-necked Parakeet Psittacula krameri, Red-masked Parakeet Aratinga erythrogenys and Monk Parakeet Myiopsitta monachus. Birds were mostly distributed in the built-up area, the proportion of urban parks per square determining the number of species and the number of individuals. Despite of the fact that the parks were strongly selected comparing with other landscape features, birds used only 24 out of 130 parks. Parks selected by birds were greater and they were less isolated than the rest. Conclusions: In Valencia, introduced species could be clearly considered as urban birds. Moreover, birds were associated with specific parts of the city. This pattern could be related with the small size of the populations, perhaps because of a low breeding success, with the great quantity of feeding resources near the breeding sites and with the tendency of new escapees to join to the established groups.

Location: Córdoba, Southern Spain (37°55´N, 4°55´E). Methods: We studied breeding success, laying phenology and nest movement in a population of 26 breeding pairs of Red-necked Nightjar during 1994 and 1995. During 1996, 1997 and 1998 we collected additional data on nest site reuse on 25 nests. For each nest, we considered the following measures of reproductive success: hatching success (proportion of eggs that hatched), fledging success (proportion of hatchlings that resulted in fledged young) and breeding success (proportion of eggs that resulted in fledged young). Statistical analysis was performed using Chi-Square test, Kruskal-Wallis test and Spearman correlation. Results and Conclusions: Breeding success did not differ between years but we found significant differences within the season. In both years, successful nests were those with earlier laying dates than in unsuccessful ones. Laying phenology patterns were very similar for 1994 and 1995 with median laying date corresponding to 19 May. Clutch size did not differ between years but there were significant differences between successful and unsuccessful nests. We failed to find any evidence of nest movement during the incubation period but during the fledgling period nest movement was very common and our results do not support previous claims on nest movement during the incubation period.

HAYES,,"Aims: The Great Pampa-Finch Embernagra platensis is represented by four subspecies belonging to two distinct groups occurring in allopatry: (1) nominate E. p. platensis in the east; and (2) E. p. olivascens, E. p. gossei and E. p. catamarcanus in the west. Morphological variation within the complex was assessed to infer the taxonomic relationship between the two forms. Location: Southern South America. Methods: Several size, plumage and soft part traits were measured for 339 specimens and analysed with univariate and multivariate statistical methods. Results: I found no evidence for long-distance migration, conflicting support for Bergmann´s rule (body size negatively correlated with latitude and positively correlated with elevation), and more support for Gloger´s rule. The structure and colouration of the bill were the most diagnostic traits. The absence of intermediate specimens and lack of clinal variation of bill colouration within each form demonstrates that intergradation either does not occur or is potentially restricted to a narrow, still undiscovered contact zone. Conclusions: Given the likelihood that bill structure and colour, combined with other traits, may represent reproductive isolating mechanisms between the two groups, I tentatively propose the recognition of two species within the E. platensis complex: the monotypic Great Pampa-Finch, E. platensis, and the polytypic Olive Pampa-Finch, E. olivascens.",Embernagra platensis; geographic variation; Great Pampa-Finch; South America; taxonomy,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/536.pdf,December 2003,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/502/articles/223-235/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Location: Biscay (Bizkaia), North of Spain. Methods: During five years we released Eagle Owls that came from wildlife rehabilitation centres located in other sites of Spain (Madrid, Cádiz, Huelva). All of them were individuals that had been treated in wildlife rehabilitation centres. These Owls were maintained in the Centro de Recuperación de la Fauna Silvestre de Biscay during nearly 45 days, where they improved the hunting techniques and the fly muscles. At the beginning, nine owls were radio-tracked and monitored and we compared two release methods: from a cage located in the release place or directly, resulting better the second method. Results: We released 64 Owls. Nineteen released Owls were found dead after 101 days, on average. They dispersed an average of 9.55 km. There was not correlation between the travelled distance and the time. We also located 10 Owls that had settled in territories. The average distance between the release point and them was 8.07 km. There were not differences between the distance travelled by the recovered Owls and the territorial Owls. Finally, we recorded three cases of reproduction.

Although there is a confirmed breeding record, as well as sporadic records of birds during both winter and summer, the species is mainly seen during migration and very rarely. Only along the north-eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula (Catalonia and Valencia regions) is it recorded on a regular basis annually, although in very low numbers. In the rest of the Peninsula and on the Islands, it seems to be rare or very rare. Spring migration extends from the end of February until May, with peak movements in March-April. The autumn migration is much less apparent and appears to take place between August and December, with maximum intensity in October-November. Spring migration dates appear quite early when compared with those published for France and central Europe, while those for autumn migration are delayed. These differences suggest migratory movements with long resting periods. Because of the scarcity of the species and the comparative difficulties of a correct identification, which raise doubts about several published records, it may be recommended that future records should be examined by the Spanish Rare Birds Committee.",Balearic Islands; bird migration; Canary Islands; Iberian Peninsula; Little Crake; Porzana parva; Rallidae; status,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/515.pdf,June 2003,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/501/articles/5-13/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The average count was 1148 individuals (337 males and 811 females) distributed in 13 leks. The species´ distribution is highly fragmented, due to the presence of urban areas and infrastructures. Comparison with earlier censuses suggests that the cessation of hunting in 1980 could have favoured a recovery of the population and probably a concentration of birds at the habitat patches less disturbed by urban development. Throughout the last five years numbers have remained approximately stable, with slight oscillations that have affected much more the males than the females. Male mortality is high in Madrid as compared with populations with a more favourable conservation status. The Great Bustard population in Madrid is still highly vulnerable and some leks could be threatened with extinction in a near future, if strict conservation measures are not implemented urgently.",Distribution; Great Bustard; Madrid; Otis tarda; population size,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/517.pdf,June 2003,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/501/articles/21-29/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wing morphology was first analysed by means of a principal component analysis (PCA) on primary lengths, which corrects for allometric effects on wing shape. Two-way ANOVAs were then used to test for differences in wing morphology according to age, month and their interaction. The PCA produced two components that were related to flight-related traits, namely wing convexity and wing-tip roundness. Primary feather wear was the factor that produced most differences between ages, since adults had a more convex and rounded wing than juveniles at the outermost edge of the wing. Monthly differences in wing shape appear to indicate that differential time of migration among morphologically distinct ages could have accounted for temporal variation in wing shape, pointing that adults increased the wing components during migratory passages while juveniles showed little variation. The existence of a morphological trade-off between costs of manoeuvrability and costs of migration is discussed in order to explain differences in wing shape between ages.",Acrocephalus scirpaceus; age classes; migratory waves; PCA analysis; wing shape,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/518.pdf,June 2003,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/501/articles/31-37/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first (indirect) approach implied the ordination of the sampling sites by means of principal component analysis (PCA) of the environmental variables determined at each sampling site, followed by the regression of the specific abundances on the gradients described by the PCA by means of generalized linear models (GLM) assembled by polynomial regression. The second (direct) approach involved the simultaneous ordination of the sampling sites and the studied species by means of canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of abundances constrained by environmental variables, followed by GLM polynomial regression of abundances on CCA axes. The first three PCA axes explained 47.5% of the total variability in environmental data. Our indirect approach allowed us to obtain 6 out of 8 statistically significant GLM models, being their corresponding goodness-of-fit between 26.9% and 47.1% of the original deviance in abundance data. Both the first and all the CCA axes were statistically significant, as verified by means of Monte Carlo permutation tests. Canonical axes represented a good solution to the global ordination of species abundances as a function of explicative environmental variables (explained inertia = 36.6%), segregating species by means of their habitat selection. After partialing out the effect of physical variables (altitude, slope and direction), the principal explicative variables (21.3% of the total inertia) were descriptors of habitat structure (relative cover by herbaceous vegetation, ferns, heath shrubs, tree shrubs, spiny gorses and rocks). By means of our direct approach a total of 6 out of 8 statistically significant GLM models were obtained, being their goodness-of-fit from 34.4% to 72.3% of the corresponding null model deviance. Goodness-of-fit of the significant models obtained with both approaches was statistically superior in the GLM models obtained following CCA than after PCA (Wilcoxon signed ranks test: Z = 2.023; n1 = n2 = 5; P = 0.043). In conclusion, when modeling the bird-habitat relationships the direct approach (canonical correspondence analysis plus appropriate GLM modeling) seems to be more effective than the indirect approach (principal components regression). The models obtained allow improving previous descriptions of bird habitat selection, adjusting them to the high resolution of our research scale, which makes them useful in the management of the Natural Park montane, non-forest habitats.",Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA); habitat selection; models of response; montane non-forest passerines; multivariate analysis; principal components analysis (PCA); principal components regression (PCR),,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/520.pdf,June 2003,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/501/articles/47-58/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, the general low quality of environmental impact studies, and thus the assessments derived from them, makes them useless for accomplishing this task. In this paper we review biological information potentially useful for the proper development of studies of environmental impact on raptor populations in Spain. Our main aim is to analyse whether the low quality that characterizes this type of studies is due to a lack of relevant biological information on raptors, or to limitations, either intrinsic or extrinsic, of the environmental impact assessment process itself that intends to protect raptors populations from potentially harmful human activities. Based on a selective literature review, we conclude that there is sufficient biological information to carry out proper studies of the impact of human activities on most Spanish raptor populations, provided that the focus is on the effects on nesting places and home ranges; however, there is a general lack of relevant information needed to evaluate impacts on populations and metapopulations. We suggest that both the environmental impact studies and the professionals who work on them should be monitored much more closely by the public administration, in order to prevent malfunctions or wrong assessments from an ecological viewpoint. Also, we indicate which are the main limitations encountered when analysing impacts on a large-scale basis, i. e. on raptor populations and metapopulations. In order to solve problems associated with the latter, we recommend, on the one hand, the acquisition of proper ecological data and information, and, on the other, the implementation of Strategic Environmental Assessments of Plans and Programs of Development.",demography; environmental impact assessment; environmental impact studies; habitat selection; population dynamics; raptors; scales of analysis; strategic environmental assessment; umbrella species,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/526.pdf,June 2003,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/501/articles/85-102/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PALOMINO,,"Differences in the number of breeding landbird species among the Canary and Selvagem islands (Fig. 2) are analyzed according to physiographic-geological and vegetation variables (area, distance to mainland, maximum altitude and age of each island, average structural complexity of habitats in each island, and within-island habitat diversity; Table 1). A hypothesised model of relationships among variables was tested by means of a path analysis (Figures 1 and 3). Variation among islands in species richness supports the area per se and habitat diversity hypotheses. Within-island habitat diversity was closely related to the altitudinal range of the islands, but it was independent of area or geological age of islands. Distance to mainland negatively affected species richness. This is a striking result considering that the Canary and Selvagem islands are not a remote archipelago and that birds are a taxa with high disppersal abilities. Neither the average structural complexity of habitats in each island, nor the age of the islands had a significant contribution to the differences in species richness among islands.",Canary Islands; insular biogeography; landbirds; path analysis; Selvagem; species richness,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/501.pdf,December 2002,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/492/articles/211-221/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alexandre CABRAL; Ricardo LOPES; J. Carlos MARQUES; John GOSS-CUSTARD,,"Traditional salines are important and threatened feeding habitats for migratory and wintering waders in most Mediterranean estuaries. The salines of Mondego estuary (Western Portugal) are among the last ones of this type in Portugal. They were used as feeding areas by 42% (over low-tide) to 71% (over high-tide) of all waders present in the estuary. Although most species showed a flexible response to the habitat’s heterogeneity, and can still use the salines for a long time after salt production has ceased, there was a strong tendency for salines that are still producing salt ('active salines') to be used more by waders than inactive or abandoned ones. The loss of feeding opportunities resulting from the abandonment of the salines could amount to a 90% loss of space and a 38% loss of feeding time for some species. If all the active, inactive and abandoned salines were to be totally removed, the extra number of bird feeding-hours that the remaining intertidal flats would have to provide would be an additional average of 37% of those that they provide at present, although varying across bird species from 0.5% to 90%. The loss of all the salines could therefore be detrimental, in the long-term, for several wader species.",feeding; habitat loss; management; Mondego estuary; traditional salines; waders,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/502.pdf,December 2002,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/492/articles/223-240/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All individuals stayed close to the nest until the age of 13-14 weeks, when they dispersed. The first locations obtained beyond the nesting territories were to the southwest, two in northern Africa, at 730 km and 1.012 km of distance respectively, and the third in the island of Mallorca, at 145 km. These data suggest that the first dispersal movements aren't within local range, but displacemens of long distance that would coincide with the definite abandonment of the nesting territories. The three juveniles displaced, sooner or later, towards Northwest of the African continent. During dispersal, maximum speed of 253, 218 and 241 km/day were observed, with averages of 253, 187.5 and 131 km/day, figures which are very similar to those obtained from Northern European data. Up to now, recoveries of juveniles Ospreys ringed in Minorca and Corsica have been made on Mediterranean shores, but satellite tracking suggests that juveniles can disperse towards the Atlantic coasts of North Africa and even reach the tropics, distances which are more representative of real migration. Two subjects stayed for 4 and 1.5 months on river banks, 83 and 138 km respectively far from the sea. During this time they moved within a radius of 7 and 11 km respectively, probably feeding exclusively on freshwater fish. This result suggests that the Mediterranean examples can exploit regularly the food resources of the lake and river areas away from the coast, a fact which has not been recorded until the present study.",juvenile dispersal; Mediterranean; Minorca; Osprey; Pandion haliaetus; satellite-tracking,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/504.pdf,December 2002,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/492/articles/249-257/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the first analysis we considered 82 localities, while the second was based on presence-absence data for the species along 100 m transect lines (1036 transects in 34 localities). Short-toed larks were present in 82% of the census localities. Its abundance was primarily linked to habitat type, longitude and bioclimatology. General linear models including these variables explained approximately 40% of the variation in the abundance of this species. Lesser Short-toed larks displayed a more restricted breeding distribution (33% of localities) and its abundance was basically linked to the type of habitat (29% of variance explained by the model). In winter, the localities where this lark was contacted were the same as in spring. Annual rainfall was the only predictor variable for abundance in winter (26% of variance). The transect lines where Short-toed Larks were contacted differed in practically every structural parameter of vegetation from those where it was absent. This pattern was similar for Lesser Short-toed Larks in spring, while in winter there were differences in the cover of short shrubs (",habitat segregation; habitat use; Iberian Peninsula; Lesser Short-toed Lark; Short-toed Lark; sibling species; sympatry.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/505.pdf,December 2002,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/492/articles/259-272/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From January 2001 to July 2002, 92 individuals, both juveniles (EURING 3 or 5) and adults (EURING 4 or 6), were captured in several localities of the Fuerteventura Island (Canary Islands, Spain). From 24 June to 2 July 2002 the moult pattern of 26 individuals were studied in detail. The postjuvenile moult was partial, whereas the postbreeding moult was complete. The moult period lasted from April-May to July in adults and from March to July in juveniles. The postjuvenile moult included all lesser coverts (CPe) and median coverts (CMe) and a variable proportion of the larger coverts (CMa), although males changed significantly more feathers than females. After moult is finished, ageing of spring-summer birds can be safely based on the presence of moult limits: birds with moult limits within CMa feathers are always juveniles. The CMa 8-10 and the inner web of CMa 7 are full white in adult males, whereas unmoulted CMa feathers are similar to CMa 6 in juveniles. Moreover, the inner web of the third primary covert (PC3) and PC4 are also white in the adult males whereas the outer webs are black, but grey in juveniles with a lighter tip. Wing-lengths of juvenile males were significantly larger than wing-lengths of juvenile females. The inside of the upper mandible was dark grey in adults and yellowish in juveniles. The tip of the ninth primary falls between the third and fourth primaries or, exceptionally, it is as long as the third primary. This pattern was not influenced by either age or sex. The wing tip was made by P6 and P7 (70%, n=9), by P6 (15%, n=2) or by P7 (15%, n=2). Sexing juveniles can be possible if the moult of CPe feathers had started, since CPes of adult males are black and those of adult females are grey. Besides, juvenile males showed a conspicuous light spot at the tip of CP3 and CP4 but juvenile female did not. These results showed that moult, colour of feathers changed or kept, wing length and the colour of the inside of the upper mandible can be reliably used, when considered together, for ageing and sexing any juvenile individual of the Canary Islands Stonechat.",age; Canary Islands Stonechat; Fuerteventura; moult; Saxicola dacotiae; sex; wing formula; wing length,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/506.pdf,December 2002,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/492/articles/273-281/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In each experimental visit we recorded the number and sex of the responding owls, the calling rate and the corresponding type of voice during three periods: spontaneous calls (SC; 30 min), elicited calls (PB, by broadcasting male territorial hoots; 30 min) and post-challenge period (PPP; 15 min). We conducted a survey at 17 territories in Spain, and found 10 unpaired males, six paired males and seven paired females (one male attended two females). Paired males delivered territorial hoots during the SC period and continued hooting during the PB period, while most unpaired males became silent in the PB period, and the calling rate of those that continued on hooting was lower than that for paired males. At the hearing of the intruding male´s voice, females increased their call rate. Most puzzling, females responded to male playback with mating-begging calls, not with territorial or alarm calls. In the PPP period, paired males delivered significantly more territorial calls than unpaired males. Thus, mating status may have an effect on the male´s Eagle Owl response to male playback. We suggest that: (1) the exclusive use of playback calls may bias surveys towards paired owls, (2) the combined use of recording spontaneous calling owls and the broadcast of male territorial voices may improve survey methods by revealing floaters, and (3) paired males tried to defend aggressively both mate and territory and unpaired males hooted primarily to attract females, but they tried to avoid territorial disputes with other males.",Bubo bubo; Eagle Owl; floaters; poligyny; survey methods; territorial behaviour,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/480.pdf,June 2002,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/491/articles/1-9/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The House Sparrow Passer domesticus is a very common bird, and its breeding in captivity can be of interest for many researchers. However, captivity breeding of House Sparrows is difficult and has been rarely successful. After one unsuccessful year (1999), in the next (2000) we achieved that one colony of House Sparrows reproduced successfully in captivity. The colony was in an aviary of 20.5 m3, with an initial density of 2.5 ind/m3. The successful year we used pup food and larvae of Diptera, together with seed mixture and rearing food, to feed the Sparrows. The use of mealworms during the 1999 breeding season was fruitless because they have toxins that are poisonous for nestlings and when used in abundance provoke their death. In the year 2000, there was an increase in almost all reproductive parameters like number of clutches, clutch size or percentage of clutches where at least one egg hatched. 38 nestlings left the nest in 2000 versus 0 in 1999. Reproductive parameters in 2000 (such as clutch size or incubation period) were similar to those found in natural conditions. Breeding season was longer and the number of clutches per nest was higher in captivity than in natural conditions. Other parameters (specially fledging and breeding success) were lower, they were at the bottom limit of those values found in natural conditions. We also detected cases of intraspecific brood parasitism and infanticide that are discussed.",captivity breeding; House Sparrow; Passer domesticus; reproductive success,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/481.pdf,June 2002,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/491/articles/11-17/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this area these species show a certain segregation due to geographical factors. P. collybita occurs mainly in the central part of the Duero plain and in the Sistema Central, including its southern slope, although it is always scarce and dispersed. In these areas, mainly formed by open habitats, it is restricted to high and dense riparian forest. P. brehmii is mainly present in the mountain and premountain areas of northern Castilla y León (Cordillera Cantábrica and El Bierzo) where apparently P. collybita is extremely rare. In these areas P. brehmii usually has high abundance levels, is not restricted to riparian forest and is also present in other non riparian forests.

Furthermore, we tested whether body condition and age has an effect on the average preferred direction. Birds with small flight muscles decreased their migratory activity towards the end of the season, whereas birds with medium or large muscles did not. Perhaps, among the birds with small muscles, there were more individuals which were going to stay over winter in Iberia. Surprisingly, birds with low fat reserves were active more often than birds with high fat reserves. Among juveniles, more birds were active than among adults. Neither age nor body condition significantly influenced orientation behaviour. We interpret the higher proportion of active individuals among juveniles and birds in poor body condition as an expression of stronger reaction to the stress situation of the experiment compared to the adults and the birds in good condition, respectively. The fact that we did not find any influence on orientation behaviour might be due to stress reactions or other unkown factors which might have outweighted potential effects of age or body condition.",Acrocephalus scirpaceus; fat reserves; flight muscle; migratory activity; migratory behaviour; orientation cage experiments,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/483.pdf,June 2002,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/491/articles/29-37/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They also represent the first palaeontological record of both species in the Canary Islands. The taxonomic status of the Petrel is discussed, as well as the possible origin and causes of extinction of both species, which seem to be different for each one, although in either case extinction seems to have been associated to the human occupation of the island. The bones discovered, like most of the palaeornithological findings on islands, show some of the diversity changes suffered by all insular ecosystems. This fact supports the idea that biogeographical analyses could have little reliability if recent extinction records are not taken into account. These affect a high number of species and, in the case of the Canary Archipelago, like in other oceanic islands, seem to be a direct consequence of a relatively recent human colonisation.",Accipiter gentilis; biogeography; Canary Islands; El Hierro; extinction; fossil; Pterodroma sp.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/484.pdf,June 2002,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/491/articles/39-49/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In both sexes, a decreasing trend from March to June in the haematocrit was observed, although it was significant only for males and between these extreme months. There were not significant differences between helper and breeding males.

Spanish population is estimated at 2435-2743 pairs, which represents a mean density of 5.1 pairs/1,000 km<sup>2</sup> and increases in 50% the previous estimate. The Peregrine Falcon was more abundant in the regions with limestone substrate in the north and east of the country, whereas its density reaches the lowest level in the southwest quadrant, an area with few cliffs and good densities of potential competitors like the Bonelli´s Eagle Hieraaetus fasciatus and the Eagle Owl Bubo bubo. In order to know the factors that could influence the species density, a multiple regression analysis was carried out with data from provinces with specific censuses or local atlases with good coverage. The resulting equation explained 68.67% of the total variance and included three predicting variables: type of geological substrate, lenght of seacliffs and latitude. This equation was used to check the reliability of the population estimates from provinces with poor quality data as well as to calculate the expected density in the two provinces for which only partial data were available. Overall, the recent trend of the Spanish population appears to be positive, although in several regions the species shows a downward trend attributable to the incidence of pesticides, nest-robbing and competence with the Eagle Owl.",Density; environmental variables; Falco peregrinus; Peregrine Falcon; population size; Spain; threats,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/487.pdf,June 2002,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/491/articles/67-74/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spring migration, though weakly registered, takes place between late April and mid May, breeding between late May and late July, and autumn migration starts by mid July in adults and late July for juveniles. Both adults and juveniles undergo a partial moult before migration, between July and first half of August, in which only body feathers are affected, and at less a part of the local population moult in the breeding area. Biometrics is similar to those recorded for other populations. Males have proportionally larger wings than females, as adults than juveniles do. No other differences in biometrics have been observed. Sex-ratio is 1.4 and productivity reaches only 0.3.

Recent studies have shown that it is possible to detect the effects of a changing climate on individual and ecosystem levels. Among biologists, there is a growing concern about how global climate change may affect the phenology, physiology and distribution of plants and animals. Many phenological processes, such as the date of flowering, leaf unfolding, insect appearance, and bird reproduction and migration, have been affected by recent climate change. Although it is difficult to prove that climate change has been the cause of these effects, these findings emphasise the need to consider climate change for current and future conservation efforts. There is a particular interest in the study of how species have responded to climatic changes in the past in order to guess or predict how they may respond to future changes in different regions. Few bird studies and even fewer long-term bird data sets are currently available in the Mediterranean area. Therefore, it is essential for the scientific community, policy-makers and the general public to make them available. Amateur naturalist and ornithologists can provide essential records that, combined with climate date, can suggest predictions about the future impact of climate change in the Mediterranean basin.",birds; climate change; Mediterranean; migration; phenology,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/494.pdf,June 2002,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/491/articles/109-120/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty-two bird species belonging to 9 avian families have been recorded, 69% of which belonged to Psittacidae, Estrildidae and Ploceidae. Only one species can be considered as exploited wildlife and the rest as pets. Twelve species have bred in the study area, Psittacidae being the family with more breeding species. We have detected an increase in both the number of species and the number of exotic birds in Comunidad Valenciana all through the study period. This increase does not seem to be a consequence of an uneven census effort, but results are far from conclusive due to the nature of the information sources used. Exotic birds were registered in 63 localities with a mean of 2.38 species and 4.54 records per locality. For the whole study area, a higher abundance was found for Psittacidae and Estrildidae species. Their number was not associated to any habitat type. However, while the more frequent records of Psittacidae species were found in both urban and wetland habitats, the higher records of Estrildidae were in wetland habitats. For these two families, we obtained a discriminant function to differentiate between localities with records and without them (86 and 92% of correct classifications, respectively). Human density was the most important variable used to differentiate among localities.",biological invasions; Comunidad Valenciana; discrimint analysis; distribution; Estrildidae; exotic species; habitat use; Psittacidae,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1294.pdf,December 2001,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/482/articles/149-160/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PÉREZ,,"The alula is a high lift device located at the leading edge of the birds wings that allows these animals to fly at larger angles of attack and lower speeds without wing stalling. The influence of the alula in the wing aerodynamics is similar, to some extent, to that of leading edge slats in aircraft wings, which are only operative during take-off and landing operations. In this paper, representative parameters of the wing geometry including alula position and size of forty species of birds, are reported. The analysis of the reported data reveals that both alula size and position depend on the aerodynamic characteristics (wing load and aspect ratio) of the wing. In addition, aiming to clarify if the alula is deflected voluntarily by birds or if the deflection is caused by pressure forces, basic experimental results on the influence of the wing aerodynamics on the mechanism of alula deflection at low velocities are presented. Experimental results seem to indicate that the alula is deflected by pressure forces and not voluntarily.",Alula; high lift devices; steady flight; wing load,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1295.pdf,December 2001,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/482/articles/161-173/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We applied two complementary methods, the G-test and a graphical analysis, to detect the spacing between conspecific breeding pairs and between both species. Golden Eagles followed a regular pattern (Table 1; Fig. 2), while Bonelli's Eagles aggregated in two principal reproductive cores, with a random spacing within them (Table 1; Fig. 1). The distribution of both species considered together did not differ from a random pattern (Table 1; Fig. 3). Intraspecific territoriality has been shown to be associated with regular patterns of distribution in a large variety of species, such as happens with Golden Eagles in the study area. On the other side, the spatial pattern observed among Bonelli's Eagle pairs seems to be associated with direct human persecution.

The species' migration routes between breeding and winter quarters, both in spring and autumn, regularly take place through Spain. In the present study, two main coastal routes are described: the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. A third one, along the Ebro valley, seems to link the other two. Prenuptial passage, more easterly on average, takes place from early March to late April, though 87% of the records are from April. Postnuptial passage takes place from early August to late October, though 85% of the records are concentrated between 11 August and 29 September. In Spain, the species seems to use a low number of localities as stopover migration sites. We propose the adoption of effective protection measures for those areas that currently lack them.

By using this strategy parasitic females increase their fitness at the same time as they decrease host females fitness. Thus, natural selection should favour the development of defensive mechanisms such as egg recognition and rejection of unfamiliar eggs by host females. We studied egg-recognition capacity, mechanisms of egg rejection and its costs in a House Sparrow population breeding in captivity, by experimentally introducing real House Sparrow eggs painted red (non-mimetics eggs) or left unpainted (mimetics eggs). A total of 30% of non-mimetics eggs and 22.7% of mimetics eggs were rejected. The responses to the foreign eggs were: removal (four cases) and desertion (seven cases).

OLEA,,"In this Forum I analyse a paper by García Fernández (2000) that contains a number of methodological problems and biases which may have affected its results and conclusions. First, it is concluded that the estimate of the size of the Lesser Kestrel population provided by García Fernández (2000) is not reliable because: a) he extrapolated census data for two subareas summing up 124 km<sup>2</sup> only to a total area of 575 km<sup>2</sup> and b) the spatial distribution of the Lesser Kestrel (LK hereafter) in this area was very aggregated around roosts (3 km radius, 28 km<sup>2</sup>), that held on average 19 times more birds than areas further from roosts (Fig. 1) and were heterogeneously distributed in the study area. In addition, the confidence interval given by García Fernández (2000) for his estimate (747-1.587 birds) appears to suffer from calculation mistakes: for a mean bird density of 2.03 birds/km<sup>2</sup> xi mum number of birds). Contrary to García-Fernández's suggestions, these latter data are not consistent with the phenology of the species (postfledging dispersal and migration), nor are they supported by a study which monitored a large roost located in the same study area (Table 1). Although further studies are required, it is suggested that the results of García Fernádez (2000) could have been an artefact of the method he used to estimate bird numbers, as the quantification of the density of birds in two small subareas (some tens of km<sup>2</sup>) could have been seriously affected by presumable local movements of the birds within the study area. Third, the author carried out an analysis of ringing recoveries to examine the premigratory dispersal of the LK in Spain using recoveries in the months of July, August and September. However, 18% of the recoveries analysed occurred in September, when migration takes place (peaking in mid-September). Therefore, the author has analysed mixed movements due to both premigratory dispersal and migration (September), a fact that could have biased the median dispersal distances and the median altitude of the ringing recoveries. I give concrete suggestions aimed at improving the census methods as well as to clarify the results obtained, and conclude that further studies are required to ascertain what are the causes of the large number of LK seen at the end of the summer at the northern border of their Spanish distribution area.",biases; Falco naumanni; Lesser Kestrel; methodological problems; premigratory dispersal,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1347.pdf,December 2001,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/482/articles/237-241/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We carried out a study in two different sites of Córdoba (Southern Spain) with apparently different patterns of nest dispersion. At each site we recorded: distance between neighbouring nests, breeding delay in relation to the earliest nest, defensive response, tolerance to conspecifics and breeding success. Our results show that nests seem to be aggregated in one site and isolated in the other.

We compared reproductive parameters with those of other sites in the Western Palaearctic. The reproductive success was not different among years, but the median laying date was. The SW-Spain Night Herons were the least productive and the earliest to breed in the Palaearctic though the comparison is difficult owing to the different methods used by each author. Neither nest height nor the number of neighbour nests influenced breeding success, pointing to an absence of density-dependent effects on the reproduction of this species in SW-Spain.",inland colony; nest height and density; Night-Heron; Nycticorax nycticorax; reproductive success; Spain,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/466.pdf,June 2001,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/481/articles/19-25/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

L.; PÉREZ-TRIS, J.; CARBONELL, R.",,"Although the attenuation of seasonality southwards in the temperate region is known to be a major determinant of the latitudinal decline in the migratory behaviour of many passerines, the spread of altitudinal migrations in southern areas as a response to similar changes with elevation still remains obscure, principally because no extensive ringing programs have been conducted in these areas. Here we use spatio-temporal changes in abundance and variations in flight-related morphology to infer differences in the migratory behaviour of forest passerines in the Iberian Peninsula, where the environmental optimum for these species moves seasonally between northern highlands (very suitable for breeding but unproductive in winter) and southern lowlands (less suitable for reproduction but highly productive in winter). According to this pattern of environmental conditions, we predict that migratory behaviour should be more intense in the highlands while sedentary behaviour should be the rule in the lowlands. We studied abundance and morphology of several common passerines (Robin Erithacus rubecula, Blackbird Turdus merula, Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla, Firecrest Regulus ignicapillus, Blue Tit Parus caeruleus and Great Tit P. major). In all species but Blackbirds, winter abundance increased in lowlands but decreased in highlands, despite some European migrants arriving at this later area for wintering. A common pattern of variation in flight-related morphology was found, birds having longer and more pointed wings in highlands. In addition, a transSaharan migrant species that we used as a control (the Nightingale Luscinia megarhynchos) did not differ in these traits between regions. Both the seasonal changes in abundance distribution and the morphological variations between regions indicate a stronger migratory behaviour of birds in highlands as compared to lowlands. This kind of movements, which are probably widespread across the Mediterranean region, are likely to constitute small-scale, altitudinal migration patterns overlapping with the broader latitudinal migratory system in the Palaearctic.",ecomorphology; environmental seasonality; Iberian Peninsula; Mediterranean forests; migratory behaviour; spatio-temporal distribution,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/467.pdf,June 2001,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/481/articles/27-46/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A.; MORÁN, S.; NAVARRO, J. R.; RICO, D.",,"We studied nesting and hunting habitat preferences of Bonelli’s Eagles in the province of Alicante. In the period between 1989 and 2000 we located all nests of the species in the study area, and their positions were translated to 1:25,000 topographic maps. Since ecological processes can be scale-dependent, we measured a series of variables (Table 1) at two different scales: in a circle of 2.8 km of radius centred on the most frequently used nest and in a second circle of 5.6 km of radius aimed at representing the Eagles’ home ranges. Due to the lack of information about the Eagle’s home range size, both scales were arbitrarily set. We compared land uses, relief and degree of human disturbance between occupied circles and non-occupied circles centred on suitable cliffs higher than 10 m selected at random. For analytical purposes, we used logistic regression models. Relief was the best predictor of nest locations at the 2.8 km-scale. At the 5.6 km-scale, we found that the surface of scrubland increased the probability of finding nests, while the surface of irrigated cultivation decreased that probability. Both models reduced low percentages of the variance of the null model, suggesting that the response of Bonelli’s Eagles to the variables was weak, that the scales, arbitrarily set, may not be biologically significant for the species, or both. We suggest that heavy and sustained persecution by man is a confounding factor when addressing the habitat preferences of the Bonelli’s Eagle in Alicante. The pattern of habitat preferences described here may not correspond with the distribution of resources that this large predator may be able to use in the absence of human persecution. Therefore, the process of habitat selection cannot be inferred from the current pattern of habitat preferences.

Mean egg volume differed significantly between years, the differences being caused by a single year with an exceptionally large mean egg size. We found no relationship between mean egg volume of the year and mean air temperatures during the three months previous to the breeding season. Mean egg volume of the year was not related to mean laying date, but was positively related to mean clutch size of the year. Mean egg size was not related to laying date or clutch size in any of the 13 years. In conclusion, egg size showed a considerable constancy in the Great Tit population studied. A review of within-population trends of egg size variation in Great Tits showed that, though most studies reported no or little egg size variation with year, time of season or clutch size, all the possible trends were found in one or another population. Moreover, different trends could be found in the same population in different years.

B.; JIGUET, F.; ARROYO, B.",,"In lek mating systems, males defend small, clustered courts visited by females to mate (HÁ¶glund & Alatalo, 1995). Lekking species should meet four criteria proposed by Bradbury (1981): (1) there is no male parental care, so that males contribute nothing to the next generation apart from gametes; (2) males aggregate at specific sites for display; (3) the only resource females find at the lek are the males themselves, that is, male genes; (4) females can select their mate(s). However, many studies have shown the existence of mating systems that do not fit completely these conditions but that still should be considered as leks. Exploded leks (Gilliard, 1969; Emlen & Oring, 1977) form one of the main categories of such «non-classical» leks. In exploded leks, males displaying in the assemblage are considerably separated and aggregation is not detectable until they are mapped over a large area (Bradbury, 1981). As a consequence, males hold larger territories, and females can forage and even nest within them (Ligon, 1999), thus apparently failing to meet Bradbury´s third condition. Here, a review of some of the main issues related to exploded leks in birds are presented, emphasising the relevance of exploded leks in the study of lek evolution and female choice, given their features intermediate between classical leks and resource-based polygyny. The family of bustards, Otididae, is proposed as a suitable model for such studies, since different variants of exploded lekking have been described or proposed as the dominant mating system in many bustard species. The actual evidence on mating systems in this family is reviewed, especially regarding the better studied species, the Great Bustard Otis tarda and the Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax. Finally, the importance of mating systems for the conservation biology of those and other exploded lekking species is discussed.",bustards; conservation; exploded leks; female choice; lek evolution,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/474.pdf,June 2001,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/481/articles/85-98/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

L.",,"In spite of the high and growing level of scientific production by the Spanish researchers on terrestrial vertebrate biology, the Spanish journals on this topic are, paradoxically, in a delicate situation that seriously threatens their future. This paper summarises the results obtained in an analysis of the current situation of these journals and their perspectives for the future. Such results are fully applicable to most scientific journals edited both in Spain and in similar countries. The international status of a journal determines the quality and quantity of original papers that it receives and publishes. The quality of the published papers was, in turn, the main determining factor of this international status until the appearance of the ´impact factors`elaborated by a private company, the North American Institute for Scientific Information (ISI). This Institute also elaborates a list of journals sorted according to their impact factors, as well as a number of criteria for the inclusion of journals in that list. Despite the fact that both the impact factors and the criteria for inclusion of journals are now under close scrutiny by the scientific community, the journals which are not included in this list are considered as ´non-prestigious`. This threatens the future of these journals because this ´label` prevents scientists from sending their good quality papers to them. Most Spanish scientific journals are not in the list, and the ISI is reluctant to enlarge it unless the journals were new, published in English and, usually, supported by the big publishers that monopolise the international market of scientific publications. Most Spanish scientific journals, especially those focused on terrestrial vertebrates, are published by scientific Societies integrated by both professional scientists and naturalists interested in the study of these organisms. The Spanish Administration partially supported some of them in the past by means of specific funds. In addition, there are/were some journals fully supported by public funds, but they have disappeared or are not published periodically. This situation contradicts the government´s objectives to promote the Spanish language and to obtain returns from the investment in training high-level scientists. On this basis, a way to ensure the long-term maintenance of the Spanish journals would be to enhance alternatives such as the publication of local studies or the support and training of novel scientists. This option may be carried out by the scientific So-cieties without institutional aid by means of i. e. reducing the subscription cost, assuming that some disagreements between the scientific and non-scientific partners were solved properly. However, this would limit the international projection of the Spanish journals. The only alternative would be a social, institutional and political agreement aimed at promoting the Spanish journals with the best perspectives of international diffusion, either already established or new. The final goal should be the inclusion of these journals in the ISI list. In this way, the coordinated efforts of scientists, scientific Societies and the Administration would eventually reach the objective of maintaining high-quality scientific journals, one of the main medium-term returns of the investment in science.",problems for long-term maintenance; scientific journals; scientific policy; scientific Societies; social and institutional support; Spain; terrestrial vertebrates,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/475.pdf,June 2001,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/481/articles/99-105/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five stages of vegetation were identified: fallow, fallow with shrubs, low shrubs, tall shrubs and mixed shrubs. The abandonment of the agricultural fields started this succession, which were then occupied by two species of the rock-rose family (Cistaceae), Cistus ladanifer and Cistus monspeliensis. The density of passerines increased with succession. In fallows, the most common species belonged to the family Alaudidae, while Sylviidae were the most frequent in the shrub stages. Generally, the numbers of passerine species and the total number of species increased with successional stage while the number of non-passerine species decreased. Migratory and granivorous/insectivorous passerines were the most abundant in sparse fallow but were replaced by resident and insectivorous species in later stages. The proportion of passerines feeding on the ground or in the air decreased while the proportion of passerines feeding on vegetation increased with successional stage. Passerines nesting on the ground decreased with succession but passerines nesting in shrubs increased. Protecting the fields with the highest densities of non-passerine birds and letting the fields with steep slopes undergo a long-term vegetation succession seem to be the best measures for the management of these areas.",agricultural abandonment; Alentejo; bird communities; Cistus ladanifer; Cistus monspeliensis; old fields; succession.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/444.pdf,December 2000,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/472/articles/171-181/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rainfall during early spring in mediterranean climates can be associated to large clutch sizes. On the contrary, rainfall during the nestling period may increase mortality through negative effects on hunting performance. Forest management activities in the surroundings of nests (tree-felling, resin extraction, and bush clearing) negatively affected clutch size and number of hatched eggs. Furthermore, pairs nesting on territories affected by those activities tended to change the nest on the following nesting season more frecuently than unaffected pairs.

Habitat features of 46 cliffs were characterized, incluiding cliffs with nests (n = 23) and cliffs where the species has never been detected (n = 23). For each cliff, 14 variables evaluating habitat humanisation, phisiography, vegetation, intraspecific competition and prey availability were quantified (Table 1). Eagle Owls selected smaller cliffs of lower accessibilty and located on less step slopes than those available (Table 2). This selection could be related to the optimization of the energetic costs of hunting. We observed negative relationships between cliff height and variables measuring habitat humanisation. In the semi-arid habitats considered here, the main limiting factor for Eagle Owl settlement seems to be the presence of conspecifics, a fact that is probably related to the high density of Eagle Owls (Table 2). Variables related to vegetation types, prey availability and habitat humanisation around cliffs did not differ between sites either occupied or unoccupied by Eagle Owls (Table 2).

Species richness was also recorded for 1000 random samples of four squares, to test whether the four areas with highest ornithological interest had actually more species than randomly selected ones. Results varied among taxa and with the selection method employed. Complementarity of bird species was the best of the three selection strategies: 77.3% of all species of each taxa ware included on average in the four squares selected with this method, as compared to 73.7% with the Rarity criterion and 70.8% with the Hotspots criterion (Table 1). However, all methods performed significantly better than Monte Carlo simulations only for birds (Table 1). These results suggest that bird-based selection methods provide an effective framework for evaluating bird species richness, but they are not good indicators of the species richness of other taxa. The regional scale of this approach, the different ecological requirements of the various taxa examined and the non-overlapping distributions of the rarer and more extended species may be the main reasons that could explain this lack of association.",biodiversity indicators; complementarity; hotspots; rarity; northern Spain; species richness; reserve selection.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/450.pdf,December 2000,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/472/articles/221-226/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ardeola,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/,2000,,Volume 47(2),,Are birds able to recognize their own nestlings?,,"SOLER, M.",,"Chick recognition is a subject of great importance in areas such as Conservation Biology and Evolutionary Biology. The fact that hosts of brood parasites have evolved the ability to discriminate non-mimetic and even mimetic eggs, but not non-mimetic nestlings, remains an evolutionary enigma. Here I review what is known about chick recognition in birds, and mainly, the problem of chick discrimination by host species of brood parasites. Recognition of nestlings by their parents develops in species in which parents are likely to confuse the identity of their offspring, but not in solitary and territorial species. Arnon Lotem demonstrated that although learning to recognize eggs is adaptive in the European Cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) hosts whose chicks are evicted by Cuckoo chicks soon after hatching, learning to recognize nestlings might not be so, because the cost of misimprinting (learning to recognize the parasite nestling as the parent´s own) may exceed the benefit of correct learning. The same model predicts that in species where both host and parasite nestlings remain in the nest, learning to recognize nestlings should be adaptive. In a brood parasite-host system (Great Spotted Cuckoo, Clamator glandarius -Magpie, Pica pica) in which the parasite is reared along with the host young, a series of experiments (Soler et al., 1995) demonstrated that magpies have the ability to discriminate cuckoo chicks, mainly when these are introduced in the nest at the end of the nestling period, and especially when the cuckoo chick together with a magpie chick is presented to adult magpies outside the nest. This supports the idea that Magpies learnt the features of their young at the end of the nestling period and cuckoos exploit the obligatory reaction of magpies to feed all young present in the nest. On the other hand, the discriminatory ability of Magpies against Great Spotted Cuckoo chicks was better in unparasitized than in parasitized nests. This supports the hypothesis that Magpies may learn to recognise their own nestlings as those present in the nest and may indicate that a comparison between cuckoo and magpie nestlings is the basis for discrimination. The important question is whether the Magpie´s discriminatory ability has evolved as a response to cuckoo parasitism. This possibility was supported by three pieces of evidence: (a) In the Magpie, a solitary and territorial species, the only important selection pressure for recognition appears to be parasitism by the Great Spotted Cuckoo, (b) the ability of Magpies to discriminate against alien Cuckoo chicks was always higher than against alien Magpie chicks. Furthermore, in another experimental study (c) it was demonstrated that Magpie´s discriminatory ability was higher in Guadix (southern Spain) where parasitism was frequent (about 50%) than in Freneusse (Central France) where the Great Spotted Cuckoo does not exist.",brood parasitism; chick recognition; coevolution; defence against the brood parasite.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/460.pdf,December 2000,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/472/articles/279-286/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

M.",,"The influence of altitude on laying date was studied in a Bonelli´s Eagle population breeding in south-eastern Spain (Granada province, a typical Mediterranean area). We dated 96 reproductions of 28 eagle pairs between 1994 and 1999. In addition, the influence of prey availability on laying date was studied in 1997. Laying date was calculated by means of the pterilar growth of the chicks (Appendix 1), considering an incubation period of 39 days. The altitude of the nesting sites was obtained from 1:25000 maps. Prey availability (rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus and Red-legged Partridges Alectoris rufa) was estimated from census itineraries carried out for each nesting territory (8.2 km/territory on average) during March and April. The relationship between laying date and four independent variables (altitude, density of rabbits+Partridges, density of rabbits and density of Partridges) was tested by means of stepwise linear regressions. Laying date varied between 21 January and 17 March (mean: February 10; Fig. 1), a result that agreed with previous reports for Bonelli´s Eagles in south-eastern Spain. There was a positive relationship between altitude and laying date when data from the six study years were considered together (Fig. 2), and this relationship was significant for three out of the six years when we tested the within-year correlations (Table 1). During 1997, altitude was the only variable selected by the regression analysis (R 2 = 0.395, P = 0.022, d. f. = 12; Fig. 3). There was a slight negative relationship between laying date and prey availability (partial correlation = -0.211), with a stronger association with rabbit availability (partial correlation = –0.228) than with Red-legged Partridge availablity (partial correlation = –0.121, Fig. 3). High prey availabilities as compared to other regions and/or microclimatic factors may be the causes of the marginal effect of trophic resources on the laying date of Bonelli´s Eagles in Granada.",altitude; Hieraaetus fasciatus; laying date; prey availability; SE Spain,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/424.pdf,June 2000,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/471/articles/1-8/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To do so, we considered the variation in wing length and wing formula between two partially migratory populations (Álava area, northern Spain, and Guadarrama area, central Spain) and one sedentary population (Campo de Gibraltar). From these, we obtained a discriminant function (Tables 1 and 4) which allowed us to classify correctly almost 80% of the Robins measured (n = 135; Tables 2 and 3). Wing length (third primary) showed the highest contribution to between-group discrimination (Fig. 1). By using this method, we estimated that around 58% (n = 134) of the Robins wintering in the Campo de Gibraltar area in 1998-99 belonged to the sedentary population. This proportion was much larger in the breeding habitats of these local populations (70% in forests) than in the habitats that are occupied during the winter only (40% in scrublands), suggesting a differential occupation of both environments by foreign Robins and the displacement of part of the residents away from their breeding areas during the winter.",discriminant function analysis; Erithacus rubecula; migratory populations; morphological differentiation; sedentary populations; Southern Spain; wintering,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/425.pdf,June 2000,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/471/articles/9-18/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three hierarchical classes were established using aggressive interactions between the individuals over artificial feeders: dominants, subdominants and subordinates. Sex, age and morphology were found to be factors responsible of the social organisation in the Great Tit. Adult males were the most dominant individuals and juvenile females the most subordinate. Juvenile males and adult females, contrary to prior expectations, were distributed among social classes in a way that did not differ from a random distribution. Individuals in the different social classes differed morphologically, dominants being larger and heavier than subordinates. Morphological differences among classes disappeared when the effect of sex was removed, whereas they remained when the effect of age was removed. Therefore, morphological differences among the social classes were due to differences in sex-ratios among classes. We suggest that sex per se is the main factor responsible for social dominance, although other factors such as a previous link with the area (site relation) or mating with a highly ranked bird (high ranking match) may reverse social relationships.",age; body mass; dominance; Great Tit; morphology; Parus major; sex; size; subordination; winter.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/426.pdf,June 2000,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/471/articles/19-27/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vegetation structure was measured in 14 (150 Á—30) m plots that were occupied by breeding Owls and in 12 control plots that were not occupied. Presence of breeding Owls was associated to mature but open forests in which gaps and saplings were abundant, presenting also tree cavities, dead wood on the ground, and tree stups and other perches for hunting. A discriminant function that selected five structural variables (Table 3) classified correctly 92.3% of the plots as either occupied or not. On the basis of these results, we suggest forest management practices that will enhance the presence of dead wood and trees with cavities for nesting as well as the structural heterogeneity of the habitat. These practices are ultimately aimed at favouring the persistence and expansion of Tengmalm’s Owls at the southern border of its distribution range.",Aegolius funereus; breeding period; forest management; habitat use; Tengmalm´s Owl; vegetation structure,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/427.pdf,June 2000,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/471/articles/29-36/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further evidence to that already published for gender differences in growth of different traits (fledgling tarsus length, mass and body condition) being already present early in the ontogeny in a passerine species with slight adult size dimorphism is presented. Familial and environmental sources of resemblance in both feather traits are suggested by highly significant correlations of feather growth within siblings, and within individual nestboxes independently of the identity of parents breeding therein. Retrospective analyses of gender differences in feather growth at the nest for a sample of recruited young show that feather traits of female fledglings were, on average, larger than those of males. However, the difference is reversed at recruitment due to compensatory gains in males that may be related with positive directional selection on wing length in males related to an early settlement in spring in this long-distance migrant.",Ficedula hypoleuca; growth; nest ectoparasites; Pied Flycatcher; sex differences; sexual size dimorphism; wing length,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/428.pdf,June 2000,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/471/articles/37-47/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Females spent more time feeding and resting, and less time preening than males. Feeding was the most frequent behaviour throughout the year, except in spring. Time allocated to different activities was affected by the time of day, being also related to the season of the year. Activity budgets differed among land uses, being influenced by the sex of individuals and the season of the year. The proportion of feeding was highest in pasture and lowest in ploughed land. Daily activity was also affected by the size and composition of flocks. Solitary individuals devoted less time to feeding and more time to scanning than individuals in flocks.

Breeding territories were surveyed every year so that both the reproductive success and the survival of adults could be recorded. The diet during the breeding period was also studied by mean of the analysis of pellets collected near the nests. The population is composed of 39-45 pairs and the demographic evolution was positive during the study period, so that three new pairs have been established (mean annual increase: 1.66%). The reproductive success was high, with a mean number of fledglings per controlled pair of 1.49 and a mean number of fledglings per successful pair of 1.66 (n = 132 controlled reproductions). The breeding success was remarkably constant during the study period (Table 1). Minimum adult mortality was low, with a mean annual value of 2.33% (Table 1). The positive demographic evolution was related to both the high reproductive success and, specially, to the low adult mortality recorded. Diet was based on rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus and Red-legged Partridges Alectoris rufa, with scarce local variation (n = 1,339 prey; Table 2). Diet was also very constant throughout the study period (Friedman test: 2 = 1.82; d. f. = 4; P > 0.05; Fig. 2); however, a slight, albeit nonsignificant, decreasing trend for rabbits was detected during the last three years (Fig. 1).

In each zone, the birds fed almost exclusively on one of these species, so winter diet depended on local availability. During spring the consumption of beech buds increased in all sites, and later in the season a high diversity of herbaceous plants was included in the diet. The most important food during summer and autumn was bilberry. Considering the resources that were used as monodiet, beech buds showed both the lowest caloric content and highest the fiber content.

The global pattern of association among duck species was non-random. The structure of species clumps was such that dabbling and diving duck species always avoided each other (significant Cole´s Coefficients of Association -CA- ranging between -0.57 and -0.90). Diving duck species of the same genus associated positively although weakly (CA = +0.12) and dabbling duck species mainly avoided each other (CA = -0.10 to -0.66), although with non-significant values of the Cole´s coefficient (Table 3). Therefore, the main tendency for ducks was to gather in single-species flocks. This pattern appears to be due to species-specific depth preferences (Fig. 1) although some other factors such as anti-predatory behaviour, winter mating, exchange of foraging information or maintenance in the roosting zone of the structure generated in the foraging grounds, might also account for the observed patterns, as ducks did not forage at all in the roosting area.",associations among species; competition; ducks; water depth; winter roosts.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/408.pdf,December 1999,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/462/articles/163-169/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Migration phenology was different in both age classes. The autumn mean timing of migration and the maximum intensity of passage was earlier for adult birds (1 August vs. 12 August and 25-29 July vs. 14-18 August, respectively; Fig. 1). The proportion of adult birds retrapped was lower (11.11% vs. 18.72%) and stopped over for a shorter time than youngs (2.53 days vs. 4.2 days; Fig. 2). In contrast to youngs, adults star-ted accumulating fat earlier than youngs, their body mass on the last trapping occasion being larger (13.03 g vs. 11.92 g; Fig. 4) and the rate of body mass increase being higher (0.73 g/day vs. 0.28 g/day; Fig. 4). These results could be explained by superior feeding conditions (abundance of aphids Hyalopterus pruni) in the study area during the peak adult passage than during the peak passage of young birds (compare Fig. 1 to Fig. 5), as the rate of body mass increase was closely related to aphid abundance over time (Fig. 5).",Acrocephalus schoenobaenus; age; aphid abundance; autumn migration; body mass increase; phenology; Sedge Warbler; stopover residence times; Txingudi.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/409.pdf,December 1999,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/462/articles/171-178/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main idea of this paper is to provide basic data on the breeding ecology of Coots in the southern part of the species geographic area and to compare breeding characteristics between Lakes Oubeira and Tonga. Water depth at the place of nesting and nest dimensions differed significantly between the lakes, while clutch sizes, hatchling numbers and egg dimensions were not different. Relatively many complete clutches (11%) contained only one egg. The dates of laying onset were significantly different between years 1996 and 1997 on Lake Oubeira but not between Lake Oubeira and Lake Tonga in 1997. A generalised linear model showed that hatching success (the number of eggs hatched per clutch) was dependent on both years and lakes (as factors), laying date, egg volume and water depth at nesting sites but independent of clutch size. Egg dimensions showed significant but not very high repeatabilities (0.35-0.47).",Algeria; clutch size; Coot; egg size; Fulica atra; hatching success.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/410.pdf,December 1999,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/462/articles/179-186/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This problem is aggravated when censusing nocturnal roosts, as no conventional aerial photographs can be taken to measure estimation errors. This paper explores the usefulness of thermal infrared Remote Sensing techniques to census nocturnal roosts of birds. A multispectral airborne scanner Daedalus 1268 and a FLIR (Forward Looking Infrared) MKD400NDP thermal camera, installed on board of mobile laboratories were used to carry out nocturnal census of winter roosts of Blackheaded Gulls (Larus ridibundus). The FLIR camera obtained excellent images, but in the case of the Daedalus scanner more field testing is required. The digitalisation and automatic processing of the thermal images obtained with the FLIR during a nocturnal census in the Santillana Reservoir (Manzanares el Real, Central Spain) allowed us to make automatic counts of the roosting population of gulls present there. However, further validation is required before using these methods to census groups of birds which roost during the night in open country or on the water surface.",birds census; nocturnal roosts; remote sensing; thermal images; winter.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/411.pdf,December 1999,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/462/articles/187-193/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For feathers aerodynamically functional in flight, theory predicts that deviations from bilateral symmetry in wing feathers should affect the flight more intensely than FA in tail feathers. FA should be lower in primaries than in rectrix feathers as a consequence of a possible more intense natural selection acting upon deviations from bilateral symmetry in the length of feathers in the wing than in the tail. This paper tests the above predictions working with the absolute FA in the length of Coal Tit´s Parus ater primaries and tail feathers. The results support the hypothesis of the association between the functional meaning of morphological traits and their measurable levels of FA, since, on average, population FA of wing feathers was half that observed for tail feathers. There was no association between FA and character size. The variance in FA was also higher in tail feathers than in wing feathers. Nevertheless, tail and wing FA in feather length were not significantly correlated, and feather growth rate, a measure of individual nutritional status, and FA in feather length were not associated for tail nor for wing feathers. These results do not support the prediction that FA is a valuable measurement of body condition and/or individual quality. A small meta-analysis with available data on FA and growth rate in birds showed that the relationship between these two traits is not significant and explains a low amount of variance (0.43%), which implies that there is no evidence for a general pattern in birds.",fluctuating asymmetry; individual quality; natural selection; nutritional status; ptilochronology; wing and tail feathers.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/412.pdf,December 1999,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/462/articles/195-204/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We calculated the Ivlev´s selection index for every habitat type available in the study area from the time spent by Harriers hunting in each habitat type. The selection index was positive for the natural habitat types of the area and negative for man-made habitats (Fig. 1). Prey density varied between habitats (Table 1), but we did not find any correlation between the amount of time spent by Harriers hunting and prey densities across habitats. We suggest that habitat structure would be more important than relative prey abundance in the choice of hunting grounds. For instance, although prey density peaked in lemon groves, a manmade habitat that has replaced large areas of natural vegetation, prey availability in this habitat was surely very low for Harriers due to the dense canopy of lemon tree cultivation. Logistic regression models showed that the presence of salt marshes with sparse reedbeds increased the probability of finding a Montagu´s Harrier nest, while the development of unpaved roads reduced that probability (Table 2). Reduction of the natural habitat types and increasing human presence will then have negative effects on both the hunting and breeding habitats of the Montagu´s Harrier.",breeding; habitat change; habitat selection; habitat structure; hunting; prey density; salt marsh.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/413.pdf,December 1999,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/462/articles/205-212/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The multidisciplinary approach that inspired this science assumes that biodiversity is composed by genes, species and ecosystems and that its main role is to diagnose and prevent the factors that are depleting diversity at these biological levels. There are two new issues in this discipline that have improved the traditional conservation concern of Biology in general and Ornithology in particular. The first one is the incorporation of evolutionary issues into conservation, i. e., the claim that the protection of evolutionary processes is a basic tool for developing management strategies. In this way, the avoidance of intra and interspecific hybridisation, inbreeding or loss of genetic diversity in small populations have become popular issues in conservation, a fact that in turn has improved a focus on populations as the proper management units. This has also produced the incorporation of scientists and of methods which have been usually outside the field of conservation (population genetics, molecular methods, etc. The second issue refers to the increasing role of scientists in the conservation arena because of the usefulness of scientific method as a way of knowing the causes of population declines (Table 2). A balance of the last two decades of Conservation Biology shows, however, pros and cons. The pros refer to the conceptual and methodological consolidation of this new discipline, as well as the increasing interest of the scientific community in conservation issues. The cons refer to the still limited usefulness of evolutionary approaches in conservation issues, given that their main effects will occur in extremely depleted populations. This is the reason why special concern must be put in the early preservation of populations and habitats. There are also other problems related to the limited scope of many studies in this field (Table 3), which restrain the development of this discipline, and the problems related to the incorporation of scientific approaches in gubernamental or non-gubernamental conservation agencies.",biodiversity; Conservation Biology; evolutionary processes; Ornithology; population management; scientific method.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/419.pdf,December 1999,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/462/articles/239-248/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Physical characteristics (such as length, size, distance from mainland and other islands, occurrence of small dunes, etc.) of eighteen islands and two peninsulas were considered; random points were selected on the islands, and several parameters (such as distance from the shore, apparent elevation above sea level, vegetation cover, kind of substrate, etc.) compared with those of a similar number of nest sites. Apart from Yellow-legged Gulls Larus cachinnans, which selected the longest and largest islands, the other species (Oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus, Kentish Plovers Charadrius alexandrinus and Little Terns Sterna albifrons) did not show particular preferences at this level. With regard to nest site cha-racteristics of each species, they were often different from random points and, less frequently, from those of the other species. Yellow-legged Gulls preferred sites with less sand, higher vegetation cover and taller plants; the opposite was true for Kentish Plovers. Intermediate characteristics were selected by Oystercatchers and Little Terns. Significant associations were found between Oystercatchers and Yellow-legged Gulls, Oystercatchers and Kentish Plovers, Kentish Plovers and Little Terns. Our study suggests that physical factors (i. e. nest site features) and behavioral factors (association resulting in better protection from predators, or due to a limited feeding overlap in the nearby intertidal areas) interact in the habitat selection of the four species studied in the Po Delta. The observed association between oystercatchers and gulls deserves further research.",association; Charadriiformes; nesting; Po Delta.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/392.pdf,June 1999,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/461/articles/1-12/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The number of feeding attempts, the foraging success, the number and the size of fishes caught were recorded forthnightly during a whole-day observation period. The influence of the foraging strategy and the relative position of individuals within the fishing group (front, middle and back) on some parameters related to foraging success and aggression rates were studied by direct field observations (Table 1). Cormorants used three foraging strategies during group fishing: line fishing, zig-zag fishing and dispersion of fish schools towards the banks of the main feeding areas (Fig. 1 and 2). The length of fishes caught by group fishing Cormorants varied among different foraging strategies and with the relative position of birds within the group. Larger fishes were caught both with the zig-zag fishing strategy and in the middle position of the foraging groups. Kleptoparasitic attacks and aggressions were more frequently observed in the middle position of groups and during the zig-zag movements (Table 2). Individuals in larger groups had a higher foraging success (Fig. 3) and made shorter dives than individuals in small groups. Direct correlations between group size and rates of aggressions and kleptoparasitic attacks were found, indicating that these aggressive behaviours are density dependent.",behaviour; Cormorant; foraging success; group fishing; Phalacrocorax carbo; wintering season.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/393.pdf,June 1999,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/461/articles/13-21/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The period of highest incidence of traffic casualties was breeding time (Fig. 1), presumably due to both the lack of experience of young as compared to adult birds (young birds were found dead more frecuently than adult birds; Table 1) and the increased road traffic. The richness of species found dead peaked during breeding, whereas the diversity of bird traffic casualties was highest during the postbreeding migration period (Figs. 2 and 3). This fact was due to the increased importance of casualties affecting dispersing young birds and tropical migrants.

These variables were used to make a habitat selection model for each one by comparing occupied cliffs with non-occupied cliffs (t-test) and by means of discriminant functions (Forward Stepwise Discriminant analysis). Only three variables were significantly different between peregrines and eagles, the distances to Eagle nests, the distances to Falcon nests and the forest cover (Table 1). Intraspecific distances were greater than interspecific distances, because both species had a tendency to nest close together in areas with a high cliff availability. However, nest-site selection models were quite different, because the Peregrine Falcon tolerated human presence better than the Bonelli´s Eagle. The Peregrine Falcon model showed six variables different from non-occupied sites, and only one of them (number of km of roads around the nest) was related to human presence, while the Bonelli´s Eagle model showed nine variables different from non-occupied sites, four of them directly related to human presence (distance to the nearest village, distance to the nearest road, number of km of roads around the nest and number of km of trails around the nest) and one indirectly related to human presence (topographical irregularity). The discriminant functions selected as variables included in the model the number of kilometres around the nest and the interespecific distance for the Peregrine Falcon (79.9% of correct classification), and for the Bonelli´s Eagle, the topographical irregularity and the distance to the nearest village (80% of correct classification). The nest-site selection divergence and the high cliff availability may decrease the interespecific competition. However, Bonelli´s Eagles excluded Peregrines Falcons from isolated cliffs that were adequate for Peregrine Falcons (n = 8).

We have analysed whether these behavioural differences were associated with differences in the origin of the birds, their size, their breeding success, their breeding experience, their breeding frequency or their faithfulness to mate and nest site. Some of these parameters have shown significant differences. The new breeders in both colonies did not differ either in their origin, their age or their size. On the other hand, the birds of a colony were on avera-ge less experienced than those of the other, less faithful to their nest-site, less successful in breeding and they presented a lower rate of return to their colony, if not a lower survival rate. These differences, obviously colony-dependent, probably resulted from differences in breeding sites -all the birds breed in deep cavities in one of the colonies and only one third of them in the other- and climatic factors (exposure to the prevailing winds). Whether they died or they moved, the breeders did not stay in an unfavourable colony as long as they did in a favourable one.

Six variables were chosen, for which individual variations could be classed into clearly distinguishable categories and for which all categories were well represented among the males present in our study population. These variables were: continuity of the white collar across the nape, colour pattern of the throat, symmetry of «V» white collar, the relative width of the black and white breast bands, the frequency of black dots on the mantle, and iris colour (Fig. 1). The combination of these six variables reliably allowed the individual recognition of all Little Bustard males (up to 55) in our study area throughout the breeding season at distances of up to 250 m with the aid of binoculars and telescopes. In areas where it is necessary to identify a much larger number of males, the addition of an extra variable would diminish the probability of two males having the same combination of variables.",field technique; individual recognition; Little Bustard; phenotypic characteristics; Tetrax tetrax.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/398.pdf,June 1999,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/461/articles/51-60/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that: (1) recruitment did not vary between years, showing high levels of spatial and temporal constancy; (2) recruitment was not affected by Blackbird density either within or among years; (3) fragment size accounted for a significant proportion of the variance of Blackbird recruitment; (4) after controlling for area effects, shrub cover in 1997 and shrub height in 1998 explained the remaining proportion of the variance of Blackbird recruitment; (5) human disturbance (rate of visitors and traffic load) and predator density (Magpie Pica pica and domestic cats) did not exert any significant influence on recruitment. Fragment size could be considered as the main indicator of the quantity of available habitat for reproduction, also decreasing human interference from park fringes and the levels of nest predation, whereas shrub cover and height could be regarded as factors of habitat quality, increasing the availability of nesting substrate and cover to rear and protect offspring.",,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/399.pdf,June 1999,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/461/articles/61-70/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differential migration according to the age and sex of birds was also analyzed, paying special attention to latitudinal differences. Recoveries of Reed Buntings in Spain occur mainly on the Cantabrian, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts and in the Ebro and Tajo valleys (Figs. 1 and 2). The origins and winter distribution of recoveries suggest two different migratory fronts. Birds from Fennoscandia and the European Atlantic countries migrate through the European Atlantic coast and winter mainly along the Cantabrian coast and in the central part of Spain. The second migratory front comes from central Europe and winters mainly along the Mediterranean coasts and in southwestern Spain. The breeding areas of Reed Buntings wintering in Spain are mainly located in central and western Europe (Germany, Benelux and France) and, to a lesser extent, in northern (Sweden, Norway, Finland, Baltic Countries) and eastern (Poland, ex-Checoslovaquia) Europe. Although most recoveries are located east of 4ºW and north of 40ºN, the autumn migration takes place mainly along the Mediterranean coast, whereas the spring migration occurs across the whole Iberian Peninsula. A trend of males to winter further north and east than females was found, whereas there were no differences in the geographical distribution of young and adult birds in winter. The sex ratio of the winter population is skewed towards females in Spain (2:1), contrary to the pattern reported for more northern countries (1:2). The arrival of Reed Buntings to Spain begins in September, although it is not important until October, and the departure takes place in February-March (Fig. 3). Males show an earlier autumn and spring migration than females. No phenological differences could be detected between adult and young birds.",Emberiza schoeniclus; migration; ringing recoveries; Spain; wintering.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/400.pdf,June 1999,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/461/articles/71-80/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P.; GARCÍA, J.; FALAGÁN, J.",,"The population of Griffon Vultures has increased dramatically from the 1970´s onwards, although its distribution area has only slightly increased. During 1997 we carried out a census of Griffon Vultures within a 2,600 km<sup>2</sup> area in the province of León (NW of Spain), in which this species had not been found breeding previously (Fig. 1). We found nine colonies and 41 breeding pairs occupying an area of 477 km<sup>2</sup>. The Griffon Vulture was first sighted breeding in this area in 1991 (pers. obs.), but it had not been found breeding in the 1979 and 1989 national surveys of the breeding population. This indicates, therefore, that the colonies reported here have been recently established in this area. The new colonies were found at 1270 m. a. s. l. on average and the mean nearest-neighbour distance between them was of 8.42 kms. Colony size varied between 1 and 9 pairs, with a mean of 4.56 pairs. The proportion of pairs that started breeding was 86.2% (n = 29), the breeding success (number of fledglings/laying pairs) was of 0.68 (n = 25), and the productivity (number of fledglings/breeding pairs) was 0.57 (n = 30). No regional variation within the study area was found in these breeding parameters (Table 1). Although reproductive parameter values from different regions and/or years could not be compared properly since they can vary according to biotic (size and density of the colonies), abiotic (weather conditions) and methodological factors, it seems that values for the new population reported here were lower than values found in other Spanish populations (Table 2). The recent establishment of this population did not seem to be related to an increase in the food supply because our estimates of the availability of carrion within the study area indicate that food would have been enough to nourish a Griffon Vulture population at least from the 1970’s. We suggest that the establishment of this population could have been caused by an increase in the number of dispersers coming from increasing populations breeding nearby, combined with favourable conditions offered by the study area: proximity to other populations, availability of food and nest-sites and, especially, a marked reduction of human persecution of the species.",Gyps fulvus; new breeding area; northwestern Spain; range expansion; reproductive parameters.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/401.pdf,June 1999,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/461/articles/81-88/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The daily body mass increase of these birds (0.96 g/day and 0.46 g/day for the reed beds with large and small aphid abundance, respectively) was similar to the daily body mass increases reported for other areas considered as critical for the migration of this species. The stop-over residence times were shorter in the reed bed with the larger aphid abundance (3.0 days vs. 4.9 days).

J.",,"The study of escorting behaviour by the Spotless Starling Sturnus unicolor was performed in a nest-box colony in a Spanish dehesa (extensively grazed open holm oak woodland). Daily observations realised on ten focal pairs showed that escorting behaviour began 4-5 days before egg laying and declined markedly between the second and third days of the laying period. Males followed their females more than the reverse, and spent up to 90% of time in the colony with the female during her fertile period. Arrivals of both mates at the colony were significantly more synchronous during the fertile period. Escorting males chased off actively other males to prevent them approaching their mate. Copulations occurred mostly during the escorting period. As males escorted their females only during the fertile period, it is suggested that escorting can be interpreted more as mate guarding behaviour aimed at avoiding extra-pair fertilisations than at protecting the pair bond. Females often succeeded in escaping their mate vigilance. Thus, our data suggest that males guarded in order to keep other males away from their female, but also to prevent females from approaching other males.",escorting behavIour; extra-pair fertilisation; fertile period; mate guarding; Sturnus unicolor.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/381.pdf,December 1998,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/452/articles/143-150/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The abundance of birds, squirrels and lizards was estimated by means of 1-3 line transects covering 3.5-9.5 km carried out within the territory of each eagle pair (Table 1). Rabbit abundance was estimated from counts of droppings carried out within 2-m wide bands along each transect. Rabbit density (No. individuals/ha) was then computed from dropping counts by means of a conversion factor developed from simultaneous counts of both droppings and rabbits carried out in one of the studied territories. Diet was characterised by means of pellet analyses (n=51). Eleven prey categories were considered: rabbits, hares, squirrels, water voles Arvicola sapidus, Red-legged Partridge Alectoris rufa, pigeons, corvids, large birds, medium-sized birds, small birds and ocellated lizards Lacerta lepida. Prey selection was analysed by means of the Savage´s index (Wi). The diet (n=238 prey) was based on rabbits (39.9%) and, secondarily, on Red-legged Partridges (24.7%).

P.",,"A survey of bird (mainly raptor) electrocutions at ten power lines in Campo de Montiel and eastern Sierra Morena is reported. During 1988-1996, 274 dead raptors of 14 species (Fig. 2) were found along 69 km of distribution power lines, with a total of 1629 pylons surveyed. Electrocution mortality was specially important for large raptors (14 corpses of Spanish Imperial Eagles Aquila adalberti, 23 of Golden Eagles Aquila chrysaetos and 17 of Bonelli's Eagles Hieraaetus fasciatus were found). Pylon design and the type of vegetation around pylons showed significant effects on mortality indices. Anchoring pylons and rigid insulator pylons (Fig. 1) caused 99.6% of the observed electrocutions. Frequencies of electrocution were significantly higher at power lines close to Sierra Morena, in areas where shrubland predominates. This result could be partially explained by larger prey (mainly rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus) density in shrublands, and indirectly by a higher density of raptors in this habitat. A negative significant correlation was found between mortality and distance to the nearest Aquila adalberti nest. This distance also indicated the distance from power lines to Sierra Morena, which is the main breeding area for most of the raptor species found electrocuted. Priorities in order to modify or replace power lines should consider the pylon design, type of vegetation and distance from power lines to breeding areas.",Aquila adalberti; Aquila chrysaetos; electrocution; Hieraaetus fasciatus; mortality; power lines; raptors; Sierra Morena; Spain.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/383.pdf,December 1998,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/452/articles/161-169/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some foraging parameters (number of foraging bouts, number of feeding attempts, percentage of success, feeding time, number of trouts caught by each bird and biomass taken; Table 1) were studied by direct field observations. Both adult Herons and Cormorants caught more trout biomass per foraging bout than juveniles. Black-headed Gulls and Grey Herons were the main avian predators due to their relative numbers in the first case and to the fish biomass taken in the second. Seasonal variation in the numbers of Cormorants, Herons and Gulls at the fish farm was found during the study period (Fig. 2). Adult Herons and Cormorants dominated the age structure of their wintering populations at the fish farm (Fig. 3). Large differences in the average number of foraging birds were found at the fish farm according to day time: Cormorants fed in the morning and in the afternoon, and both Herons and Gulls fed mainly in the afternoon (Fig. 4). The location of beak-prints in the body of injured trouts was studied (Table 2). Significant differences were found in the length of trouts caught by Cormorants and Herons during the wintering season (Fig. 5). Small trouts (50-90 g) were caught more frequently by Black-headed Gull, medium-sized trouts (130-180 g) by Cormorants and large trouts (250-360 g) by Herons. The impact of Gulls, Herons and Cormorants was estimated as less than 0.1% of the annual yield of the fish farm, but this supposed a considerable economic loss in absolute terms (5,000,000 ptas or $36,000) due to the high productivity of the fish farm.",Ardea cinerea; fish farm; ichthyophagous birds; impact; Larus ridibundus; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/384.pdf,December 1998,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/452/articles/171-182/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main idea of this paper is that temporal variation in the environment may affect traits differently and that repeatability may be a good reverse indicator of environmental sensitivity. The egg traits (length, breadth and volume) were analysed using one-way and nested ANOVAs. Significant within-clutch repeatabilies of all traits were revealed, ranging from 0.60 to 0.85. Clutch mean values of dimensions of the eggs laid by particular females both in different clutches within a breeding season and in different seasons were similar, resulting in a high repeatability of ca. 0.7. In nested ANOVAs, among-female variance components as measured by intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.62-0.66 with respect to different clutches within breeding seasons, and 0.50-0.60 with respect to different breeding seasons. Interclutch differentiation of eggs within females was low, although significant. Interyear repeatability was also analysed for the sample of males that were mated to different females in subsequent years. Repeatabilities of clutch averages ranged from the insignificant value of 0.16 for egg breadth to 0.53 for egg length, the values being on average much lower than those for females. Female Swallows, showing much interindividual variation, are considerably consistent with respect to the characteristics of their eggs, which means that sensitivity to environmental impacts does not generate a large variation in egg size. The consistent interindividual variation in egg size may have some condition-dependent component.",Barn Swallow; egg size; Hirundo rustica; temporal variability; within-individual variability.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/385.pdf,December 1998,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/452/articles/183-192/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Robins coming from the populations of Northern and Central Europe show an autumn passage which is delayed as compared to other populations, but they migrate more rapidly across Iberia. The numbers of wintering birds are roughly constant throughout late November-mid February. Robins wintering in southern Spain come from northern Europe mainly, and those wintering in eastern Spain and the Balearic Islands originate mostly in more eastern and southern European areas.

Twenty-two Coal Tits were maintained in a large outdoor aviary (4 x 8x 2 m) where food was provided ad libitum (sunflower seeds and husked peanuts). During the study period (January-March), air temperature at midday was 0.80 ºC (range: -9 to 70 ºC) and there were harsh snowstorms. Tail feathers grew more slowly and more asymmetrically in winter than in summer (Table 1). Fluctuating asymmetry in feather growth rate in winter was more variable than in summer (Fig. 1). Induced rectrices grew in only 64% of the individuals. Those Coal Tits that grew the removed tail feathers had better body condition than those birds that did not regenerate their rectrices (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, winter growth rate of tail feathers was not significantly correlated with residual of body mass in those Coal Tits that regenerated their rectrices. The onset of the growth of induced feathers in winter seemed to require a minimum amount of body reserves, but inter-individual differences in body reserves did not predict inter-individual variations in the growth rate of feathers.

M.; DÍAZ, M.",,"The editorial line of Ardeola has been improved from 1983 onwards to enlarge its scientific utility and international presence. We analyse the pattern of citation of the papers published by Ardeola between 1983 and 1996 according to the authors who cited them, to the reset topics of these papers, and to the use of the scientific literature by their authors. In addition, we compare these patterns with the patterns of citation of ornithological papers published by Spanish scientists in international journals included in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR). Patterns of citation of papers published in low-citation journals (SCI1.5) were analysed separately. Our main objective was to evaluate to what extent the goal of enlarging the international diffusion and scientific utility of Ardeola, which has directed the editorial line of the journal for the last 15 years, has been reached. Also, we tried to detect the main factors which could have delayed reaching that goal, as well as to derive efficient ways to overcome them. The average impact factor (SCI) of Ardeola (computed as the number of citations received in a given year by the papers published during the two previous years both in Ardeola and in the JCR journals, divided by the number of papers published in Ardeola during the same time period) has been 0.26 citations/year. This impact factor was six times lower that the impact factor of the ornithological papers published by Spanish scientists in top-citation journals, and marginally lower than the impact factor of the papers published by Spanish ornithologists in low-citation journals (0.36 citations/year on average). The impact factor of Ardeola has decreased markedly throughout the study period (Fig. 1). This fact was due to the decreasing citation of Ardeola within Ardeola itself (71% self-citation on average, that decreased from 87% to 47%). Low citation rate was combined with a short half-life of the papers published in Ardeola (5.8 years; Fig. 2). These results indicate that Ardeola has had a low scientific utility and a narrow international relevance. Most citations of the papers published in Ardeola came from their own authors and, to a much lesser extent, from other Spanish scientists (Fig. 3). Ardeola has been barely used by foreign scientists. These patterns differed markedly from the citation patterns of the papers published by Spanish scientists in top-citation journals, since the rate of citation of these papers by foreign researchers was much higher. Patterns of citation of Ardeola papers also differed from the patterns of citation of the papers published by Spanish ornithologists in low-citation journals, but in this case the differences were due to the larger self-citation of these later papers only (Fig. 4). Hence, the use and diffusion of the papers published by Spanish scientists was not improved substantially by the publication of these papers in low-citation journals as compared to Ardeola. Ardeola was very useful for the Spanish scientists, as indicated by the high citation of Ardeola papers that was found in the papers published by such scientists in top-citation journals (1.1% of 3700 references in 89 papers). However, these citations were too delayed from the date of publication of the papers in Ardeola (6.77 years on average), so that they barely contributed to the impact factor of the journal. We detected three main factors that contributed to explain the low scientific usefulness and the narrow international diffusion of Ardeola: (1) the research topics of most papers published in Ardeola, (2) the inappropriate use of the scientific literature by their authors, and (3) the low scientific production of most authors who have published in Ardeola. Most papers published in Ardeola in 1983-1995 (51.3%; n=249) have been descriptive studies focused on selected traits of the basic natural history of one or a few bird species; most of these studies were not developed conceptually from their descriptive focus to address more general topics, ideas or hypotheses, and this fact has limited its citation by other authors (Table 1). As regards to the use of the scientific literature, the authors who have published in Ardeola have tended to employ few references (30.8 on average) from old sources (10.2% of the references were published during the two years preceding the date of publication of the paper in Ardeola) of low diffusion and international use (32.2% were references to JCR journals); these facts have hampered both the conceptual development of the papers and their possibilities of citation (Tables 2 and 3). Finally, more that half of the 271 authors who have contributed to Ardeola in 1985-1996 have published only one paper in this journal (Fig. 6). Out of these 271 authors, 87.1% did not publish any paper in top-citation journals. On the other hand, most authors of papers published in top-citation journals did not publish any paper in Ardeola (Fig. 7). Hence, Ardeola has not been able of attracting (rather it has repelled) authors of high scientific production, either Spanish or foreigners, who could have contributed a great deal to the international diffusion of the journal. The scientific utility of Ardeola lies at present within the international ornithological journals of low impact factor. Hence, there is no reason (no bibliometric reason at least) for the current exclusion of Ardeola from the JCR list. Nor is there any reason for the current lack of consideration of Ardeola papers when evaluating the scientific production of their authors. However, Ardeola has been affected by some factors which have limited its usefulness and international diffusion. It is urgent to correct them in order to reach the goal of enlarging such usefulness and diffusion, approaching at least the level already reached by the Spanish scientists who have published their works in top-citation journals. Apart from implementing efficient publicity campaigns and easy ways for consulting the contents of Ardeola (updated inclusion in databases of rapid and wide diffusion such as Current Contents, web pages, etc.), it is necessary to increase the consideration of Ardeola as an option for publication for high-level authors (inclusion of review and forum sections within the journal, rapid publication of manuscripts, etc.). Last, but by no means least, it is urgent to promote as updated and appropriate a use of the literature by prospective authors as possible, approaching it to the current use of the literature displayed by the international scientific community. This editorial policy is aimed at contributing to improve the conceptual elaboration of the papers published in Ardeola, thus also improving its potential utility and international diffusion.",Ardeola; authors; bibliometry; literature use; ornithology; research topics; science citation index (SCI); Spain.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/390.pdf,December 1998,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/452/articles/221-239/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

L.",,"This paper studies five populations of Blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) distributed from north to south along the Iberian Peninsula. We analyse whether these Blackcap populations showed a similar pattern of habitat selection and whether habitat selection determine similar patterns of habitat use along the study gradient. Results show that all the study populations preferred forest tracts with well developed tree canopies and a dense shrub layer of plant species associated to wet substrates (e. g. blackberries Rubus spp.). The correlation between Blackcap abundance and cover of blackberries might be associated with higher food resource availability since moist grounds may attenuate the effects of the Mediterranean summer drought. In addition, it may be related to other specific requirements of the species (e. g. nesting sites). Habitat use by blackcaps differed, however, among populations since they showed site-specific adjustments to the structure of local habitats.",habitat use; habitat selection; Iberian Peninsula; regional distribution; Sylvia atricapilla.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/365.pdf,June 1998,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/451/articles/1-10/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper defines their present Spanish distribution on the basis of both published and unpublished data. Their relative abundances of both species were estimated in 28 areas of peninsular Spain both in winter and spring by means of three 5 km walk transects per area. Abundance were expressed as the number of individuals per kilometre (IKA). The literature review shows that both species have disappeared or become rarified during the course of this century, especially in the margins of their distribution area. The Pin-tailed Sandgrouse may be currently considered as relatively abundant in the Ebro Valley, South Meseta and Extremadura, being quite rare in the North Meseta, Andalucía and Levante. Besides, it tends to concentrate in certain areas, reaching high abundances locally. As for the Black-bellied Sandgrouse, the most important populations are located in Extremadura and the South Meseta. This later species is present in a larger number of localities and has a more uniform distribution than the former but it is generally scarce. The winter and spring abundances of the Black-bellied Saundgrouse in the sampled localities where the species is present (n=23) were positively correlated. On the contrary, the abundance of the Pin-tailed Sandgrouse showed a more marked seasonal variation, so that no such correlation was found in the localities where it is present (n=14). There was no relationship between the abundance of these two sandgrouse species where they do coexist. This suggests that the factors influencing the habitat preferences of each species are species-specific.",abundance; conservation; distribution; Pterocles alchata; Pterocles orientalis; seasonal variation; Spain.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/366.pdf,June 1998,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/451/articles/11-20/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within migrant species we also found that long-distance migrants have larger sternal dimensions than short-distance migrants, the leg segments showing a trend to be shorter in the former. The greater dimensions of the sternum in S. cantillans, S. atricapilla, S. borin and S. communis can be interpreted as an adaptation which favour the ability to fly in these migrant species as the bigger the sternum the greater the surface available for attachment of the main fly muscles involved in flight (pectoralis and supracoracoideus).",ecomorphology; migration; skeleton; Sylvia spp.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/367.pdf,June 1998,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/451/articles/21-27/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The spatial distribution of feeding groups was not uniform, but clumped, probably reflecting the patchy distribution of the food resources in the study area. The application of Cole's Coefficient of Interspecific Association to the observed associations indicated that only Little Egret-Cattle Egret (Egretta garzetta-Bubulcus ibis) and Grey Heron-Purple Heron (Ardea cinerea-Ardea purpurea) make up positive, although weak, associations. Single-species groups of egrets seem to be the most stable association. The local overabundance of food resources in the paddy fields seems to be the main factor which allows the unstable association of species with some overlapping in foraging-niche (mainly concerning hunting strategy). The mean size of the single or mixed groups of Cattle Egrets and Little Egrets was of approximately 8 individuals for both species. We were not able to distinguish between nuclear and attendant species in mixed flocks of Little Egrets and Cattle Egrets.",foraging associations; herons; niche overlapping; paddy fields; Spain.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/368.pdf,June 1998,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/451/articles/29-34/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This fine-grained approach has been scarcely considered in Mediterranean habitats of southern Europe. The climate of the study area is Mediterranean-semiarid (rainfall around 300 mm). Between 1994 and 1998 we examined 3670 prey items (Table 1) found in pellets of 14 pairs (6 in northern area and 8 in the southern one). The proportion of habitats in a circular surface of 2.4 km radius around each nest was determined. ""Humid habitats""included irrigable lands, groves and river banks while ""dry habitats""included dry lands, Mediterranean scrub and pine woods of Pinus halepensis. On the other hand, the density of european rabbits, the main prey of Eagle Owls in Mediterranean areas of the Western Paleartic, was estimated by means of 25 and 30 km nocturnal transects driven in winter and spring of 1995. Both subpopulations differed in the proportion of habitats available and in the availability of European rabbits found appropriate habitats (North: 25-50% of ""humid habitats"" and 10.4 rabbits/100 km; South: 0-10% and 56 rabbits/100 km). The nucleus of both subpopulations were 30 km away from each other. We carried out two principal components analysis (PCA) (Tables 2 and 3) that showed the replacement of Lagomorpha, Alectoris rufa and Invertebrata by little Muridae and Pisces in the frequency of prey items captured between the southern and the northern area and that of Lagomorpha by small Muridae, Rattus and Columbidae in the biomass contribution of prey between areas. In the northern area, Mus spretus was numerically the most important prey, while Oryctolagus cuniculus was the most captured species in the southern territories (Table 4). In terms of biomass, the rabbit was the main prey for both areas, although a lesser importance in the northern area was detected. Secondary prey showed different frequencies of appearance between both subpopulations: fish were captured only in northern territories, while reptiles and invertebrates were significantly more taken in the southern ones. Moreover, results of the PCAs showed that the importance of other prey linked to ""dry habitats""such as Alectoris and Invertebrata in the diet of Bubo, was significantly related to the frequency of rabbits in such diets, suggesting a change in the use of the habitat in northern territories. Likewise, the differences in the average size of prey (Fig. 1) and trophic diversity (Table 4) between both subpopulations was determined. The mean weight of prey was 87 g in the northern area and 266.7 g in southern territories. Only trophic diversity expressed as biomass frequencies showed highly significant variations between both areas, revealing that Bubo diversifies its energy sources in northern area due to the lesser abundance of an optimal species like the rabbit.",Bubo bubo; diet; Ebro basin; interhabitat differences; rabbit availability.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/369.pdf,June 1998,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/451/articles/35-46/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

F.",,"The aim of this work is to obtain an efficient technique for censusing owls in large areas. Up to now, most census works on this group have been carried out by means of enquiries combined with nest site or territory searches. This study added the broadcasting method and tested the efficiency of the three methods. We carried out an intensive census of nocturnal raptors in Biscay (Northern Spain) during four years (1992-1996). In this time we used three different methods: 1- searching for suitable owl nest sites, 2- enquiries to rural people and colleagues, 3- broadcasting methods. We found that the broadcasting method was most efficient for censusing Tawny Owls (Strix aluco), Little Owls (Athene noctua) and Barn Owls (Tyto alba). The response of Tawny and Little Owls to broadcasts did not vary throughout the year and was not influenced by weather conditions. However, responses by Barn Owls varied significantly throughout the year, being March, April, May and July the best months for censusing this species with broadcasting methods. Moreover, the territorial behaviour of this species was influenced by weather conditions. The two other methods allowed us to obtain some data that complemented the results obtained by broadcasting methods, and were necessary to find some secretive and scarce owls like Long-Eared Owls and Eagle Owls. On the basis of these results, the used broadcasting methods as the main technique for censusing owls and for monitoring their populations is strongly advisable. However, it must be complemented with the two other methods to obtain complete results for all owl species.",broadcasting methods; censusing methods; distribution; owls; Strigiformes.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/370.pdf,June 1998,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/451/articles/47-53/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Different methods have been used, although their accuracy has never been tested. The breeding population was estimated in 1994 at 27 different water bodies in the Llobregat Delta (NE Spain). Breeding numbers were estimated by two methods: a) call census plus territory mapping, and b) direct nest searches. Breeding call surveys gave a 19% underestimate as compared with direct nest searches. Differences occurred in localities with more than one pair. The reliability of both methods was not affected by pond size or density of breeding pairs. However, distance between nests was lower in erroneously censused ponds and nest location also introduced biases. Localities with error in breeding call surveys had less vegetated edges than the rest. Call censuses were a good method for determining the presence of breeding birds, although the number of breeding pairs was usually underestimated. Estimates obtained by nest searches were more accurate but they required a greater investment of field work. The choice between these two methods will depend on research objectives and study area characteristics.",breeding population; census biases; census techniques; Europe; Little Grebe; NE Spain; population size,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/351.pdf,December 1997,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/442/articles/157-161/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The methodology used was based on direct observations of the prey brought to the nest, given that the collection of remains at nest overestimates the importance of big bones and that the analysis of pellets (which are scarce and occasionally recycled) tends to underestimate the importance of large prey. Food availability was estimated from the mortality rates of the species of livestock present in the home range of the pair. Such livestock species accounted for 90% of the consumed prey. Sheep and goats accounted for 59% of the 64 prey which could be identified. Domestic rabbits accounted for a further 25%, cows and mares 3%, an pigs 3%. Only 51% of the prey delivered to the nest (n = 75) were bones. The pair selected sheeps, goats and domestic rabbits, and tended to avoid cows, mares and pigs. Patterns of food selection appeared to be conditioned by the biomass provided by each prey type, as well as by the mean body size and predictability of such prey.

Laying took place from early April to early July. Laying phenology followed closely the seasonal change in the availability of potential prey, namely Orthoptera and Coleoptera. Hatching success among early-laid clutches was very low (3.8%) due to high predation rates. This resulted in a bimodal distribution of the laying dates, with a second peak in June. Among clutches laid after mid-May hatching succes rose to 58.5%, what may be explained by a lower predation pressure possibly related to a general increase in food availability for predators. Average productivity, calculated by means of the Mayfield method, was 0.66-0.88 fledged chicks per pair. Most chicks were raised once the period of maximum prey availability was over, as a side-effect of the high predation rates experienced by early clutches.",breeding season; breeding success; Burhinus oedicnemus; food availability; mortality at nest; productivity; replacement clutches; Stone Curlew.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/356.pdf,December 1997,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/442/articles/199-206/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

D.; REIS, M. A.; BRUDERER, B.",,"A passive infrared device was used at the northern coast of Mallorca to study the departure of nocturnal migrants from the island during three weeks in April 1995. As the main take-off phase of the birds was within an interval of 0.5 to 2h after sunset and the south-to-north extension of the island is about 50 km, the frequency of birds declined rapidly about 3h after sunset, when the last birds from the south of the island passed the northern coast. During three nights the observations were extended beyond midnight to see the passage of migrants from the Spanish mainland and from Africa. The first birds having crossed the Mediterranean Sea from Africa flew across the observation site about 6h after dusk, indicating a high (wind-supported) average flight speed of 17 ms-1 (60 km/h). In two nights the passage continued until 11h after sunset, i. e. until dawn. These all-night observations, in combination with a few moon watch data recorded simultaneously to the norrth and south of the island, suggest that, under fair weather conditions, the number of birds landing on the island before the end of the night may be relatively small. Based on the distinct starting period and the diurnal course of migration, reasonable estimates of the distance to previous resting areas seem possible. This is an important result for a project investigating migration simultaneously by various methods (radar, infrared, moon watching) at Mallorca and the southern coast of Spain, and by moon watching along the Mediterranean coast from Italy to Portugal.",flight directions; infrared observations; Mallorca; migratory intensity; nocturnal migration; sea-crossing; spring; take-off phase.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/357.pdf,December 1997,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/442/articles/207-213/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Supplemented food (husked peanuts) was available throughout the study period. Mean daily temperature during the study period (January 2 - February 17, 1997) was 4.2 ºC. Crested tits were trapped using especially designed funnel-traps. Body mass was measured to the nearest 0.01 g with an electronic balance. Body weight was negatively related to average temperature (p=0.029; an average decrease of 0.027 g per ºC, Table 1). Average diurnal increase in body weight was 0.08 g/h and 6.9% of body weight at dawn, being these figures lower than in other wild populations of Northern Europe. This increase in body weight was markedly and significantly exponential (Figures 1 and 2; determined by means of nonlinear regression using the model W=a+bT+c[H-7]e, where W: weight, T: temperature, H: hour GMT).

The Atlantic populations appear to be nonmigratory, with the majority of recoveries occurring within 100 km of the ringing colony. This fact contrasts sharply with the characteristic postbreeding movements of Mediterranean birds, and resembles the dispersal behaviour of the Herring Gull (Larus argentatus) -a closely related species- on European Atlantic coasts. Spanish Atlantic gulls show significant differences in age-dependent dispersal distances, with inmature birds moving apparently further from breeding colonies than adults. Such age-related differences were not found in the Mediterranean population. Dispersal distances also show a clear seasonal trend, with a reduction in the range of distances from May to September for Atlantic gulls and from March to June for Mediterranean birds. The populations in the Spanish Atlantic seem to be quite isolated from other populations of Larus cachinnans. In Galicia there are some indications of a distinctive wintering area for inmature birds in the coastal northern half of Portugal.",movements; Northern Spain; ringing; Yellow-legged Gull.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/338.pdf,June 1997,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/441/articles/19-26/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

E.",,"This paper focuses on fruit choice criteria by the two most abundant frugivorous birds wintering in olive orchards in southern Spain. We analysed the choice of olive size by Blackcaps Sylvia atricapilla and Song Thrushes Turdus philomelos using both experimental and observational approaches. In the experimental approach, olives were classified in four different size classes and trials were conducted with captive individual birds by offering pairs of fruit sizes. We recorded the number of successful feeding attempts (those in which the whole fruit was swallowed) and the handling time necessary to achieve a successful attempt. For the observational approach, we compared the frequency of occurrence of olive seeds in bird diet samples from olive orchards (large-sized fruits) and from a wild olive shrubland (where olive fruits are considerably smaller). We also compared the frequency of seed sizes found in diet samples with the frequency of occurrence of seed sizes from fruits available in the field. In the trials both bird species choose the smaller fruit class of each paired choice, this tendency being stronger for Blackcaps. Criteria leading to this choice were: a) to maximise the benefit obtained per handling time necessary to achieve success; b) to minimise the ingested seed load. Both in olive orchards and in the wild olive shrubland birds tended to feed on small fruits (at least when fruits were swallowed whole, not pecked). In diet samples from olive orchards, we found a frequent presence of pulp alone, only rarely of seeds, whereas seeds occurred frequently in diet samples from the wild olive shrubland. We hypothesize that this pattern is due to the scarcity of olives small enough to be swallowed whole in olive orchards. This would cause a decrease in the benefit/cost ratio and a subsequent shift to a more profitable feeding behaviour (pecking of the pulp).",benefit/cost ratio; frugivory; fruit choice; olive orchards; Sylvia atricapilla; Turdus philomelos.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/vol-44-f-1-p-027-039-2_1677577388.pdf,June 1997,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/441/articles/27-39/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our aim is to compare the level of reserves in this area with the normal wintering areas in Europe and to ask if it is a population-specific trait or, alternatively, if there exists some degree of plasticity. We found a high negative correlation between the mean and minimum temperature of a few days preceding capture and body mass (best correlation for 8 days).

A detailed distribution map of the Little Bustard in the Iberian Peninsula is presented for the first time. Its population status differs considerably among regions: in the Southern Meseta, Extremadura and Alentejo the distribution is practically continuous, showing high densities (a guess of 170,000 breeding males is provisionally advanced for the Southern Meseta and Extremadura); whereas in the northern half of the Peninsula and most of Andalucía it is present in small areas and usually at very low densities, apparently having experienced important decreases.

Among the Upper Pleistocene localities, a selection of those most representative was made due to their fossil richness and geographical situation. Every Early and Middle Pleistocene deposit has been included because of the small number of them and the scarcity of remains. Unfortunately, some of the richest classical localities were to be disregarded for the present study. They offer quite a few of doubts about sedimentary and taxonomical identifications as well as correlations. Middle Pleistocene is represented by localities whose environments were characterised by bodies of water, as the most remarkable fossil groups in each site seem to indicate.

In the first, mealworms were offered at the nestboxes of certain pairs during the laying days. No effect of food supplementation on clutch size and egg mass was detected. There was a significant advancement of the onset of incubation in the supplemented group, with the consequent advancement of hatching date. Females used only the extra food to combine laying and incubation earlier. In the second experiment, two chicks were added or removed soon after hatching, and fledging success, fledgling mass and size and starvation mortality compared between the reduced, control and enlarged broods. Chicks in enlarged broods suffered a higher starvation mortality and fledged with lower masses than in control and reduced broods, while there were no effects of the brood manipulation on parental condition.

To date, not much attention has been paid to the possibility of changes in female choice criteria throughout a breeding season, in particular where choice cues include territory characteristics. This toptic was investigated in Penduline Tits (Remiz pendulinus). Previous studies revealed the importance of nest quality in Penduline Tit for female reproductive success and its role in female choice given benefits of improved insulation. However, one might predict that the insulation capacity of the nest is most important in the early breeding season, when the ambient temperature is expected to be low, and decreases across the breeding season. In line with this, other factors, such as male intrinsic quality (expressed in morphology or male display behaviour) could become more important later on. This study examines the importance of different mate choice cues throughout the breeding season by comparing the quality of chosen and not chosen males (considering both morphological and behavioural parameters), nest quality (considering size), and the variation in mating success among males. The results show a significant decrease in the importance of the nest with the season while male display behaviour becomes more important. Nest size does not change throughout the breeding season, and there is also a significant repeatability in nest size within successive nests of one male. Thus, the decreasing importance of nest size for female choice is not reflected in male nest building behaviour. Rather, the significant repeatability indicates that male nest building skill may have a genetic determinant.",male quality; mate choice; nest quality; nest size repeatability; Penduline Tit; Remiz pendulinus.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/314.pdf,June 1996,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/431/articles/19-29/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Territorial males sing at the highest rate during the period of territory establishment and pair formation, declining to a lower level during the fertile period of the mate and remaining at a low (but partially higher) level afterwards. This result, together with the observation of a constant high rate of song produced by a male which lost his mate, support the mate-acquisition and territory-establishment hypotheses on the functions of song, and suggests that the decrease during the fertile period of the mate may represent an attempt by the males to hide the fertility status of their mates from potential male competitors. The partial increase in song rate during the neighbouring females' fertile periods suggests an EPCs seeking function. Males do not adjust their singing rate to avoid detection of nest during the time of potential brood parasitism by the Cuckoo Cuculus canorus, and they sing much less during the period of nest occupancy, in this way perhaps eluding nest detection by potential predators.",breeding stages; Cercotrichas galactotes; mate-acquisition; song; territory-establishment.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/317.pdf,June 1996,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/431/articles/49-56/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A.",,"We studied the breeding biology of Kentish Plovers (Charadrius alexandrinus) in Fuente de Piedra lake (southern Spain) in 1991 and 1992. Breeders showed sexual dimorphism in tarsal length and body mass; body mass decreased throughout the breeding season only in males. Laying dates spanned 88 days in 1991 and 110 in 1992. Eggs deposited in the late nesting season were larger than those in the beginning of the season. Females incubated during daytime and males during the night. Apparent clutches of 1-2 eggs occurred mostly late in the nesting season and reflect a high incidence of partial predation (recorded in 17% of 288 2-3 egg clutches). Nest predation increased in the course of the breeding season, and only 19% of all clutches produced chicks. Variables measured for each nest site (nest cover, distances to water and to nearest neighbour) did not influence nest predation. Kentish Plover pairs that lost clutches usually renested together, on average 11-24 days after loss of their previous clutch. The body masses of females were similar between first and subsequent replacement nestings. Biparental care of chicks lasted longer than in several other populations of Kentish Plovers. When the chicks were 15-20 days old one of the adults, usually the female, deserted the brood. Gull-billed Terns (Gelochelidon nilotica) preyed on chicks up to 16 days of age. Both sexes showed antipredator behaviours (alarm calls, mobbing). Possibly, the greater maternal protection of the brood at Fuente de Piedra compared to other breeding locations results from an interrelationship between high predation pressure and type of predators, since mobbing of Gull-billed Terns by adult plovers was effective in deterring the terns. After deserting broods, some females mated to new males (sequential polyandry). Sequential polygyny was recorded in males that fledged chicks early enough for a subsequent nesting attempt. We propose that the duration of the breeding season and high clutch failure rates constrained the frequency of sequential polygamy in our population.",breeding biology; brood desertion; Charadrius alexandrinus; parental care; mating system; sequential polygamy.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/319.pdf,June 1996,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/431/articles/69-85/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On average, only 0.6 magpie chicks fledged per parasitized nest. The reproductive failure of the Magpie was due to both egg destruction by adult cuckoos and nestling cuckoos outcompeting Magpie chicks. Two experiments were carried out to determine the separate effects of the parasite female and the parasite chick on the breeding success of the Magpie both when the parasite egg was laid early and late in the Magpie laying sequence. In the first experiment? in which we simulated the late laying of a parasite egg, we found that the difference between breeding success in unparasitized and naturally parasitized nests was due entirely to egg destruction by adult Great Spotted Cuckoos. In the second experiment, where we simulated early laying of the parasite egg, the main difference between breeding success in unparasitized and naturally parasitized nests was due to the higher competitive ability of cuckoo nestlings.

Until the 1980's this subspecies seemed to be concentrated along the coast south of Valencia. Since 1991-1992 this pattern has changed, and up to 10465 birds have been recorded northwards, along the Catalan coast. The subspecies is distributed along the Valencian and Catalan coasts in nine main areas and numbers vary, reaching a total of ca. 8000-11000 birds. The accuracy of these figures and subspecies identification is discussed. An increase in the wintering population of Balearic shearwaters in Catalan waters has been noted. No parallel increase in breeding populations has been reported. Therefore, a northwards displacement of its main wintering area is a possible explanation. A trophic hypothesis is suggested to explain this winter distribution, given that some important changes in clupeid stocks of the extreme western Mediterranean have been noted. Observed numbers match the known breeding population and post-breeding counts, and thus almost the whole population of the subspecies may occur during the winter in the study area.",Balearic Shearwater; Mediterranean; NE Spain; Puffinus yelkouan mauretanicus; winter distribution; winter population.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/303.pdf,December 1995,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/422/articles/161-166/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mass loss was positively related to the number of nestlings in the brood, while it was independent of breeding phenology and female age. Higher mass losses of females were unrelated to female survival, while they were associated to advanced breeding dates the following year in surviving females. Females paired to males in prime condition at the middle of the nestling period had significantly lower mass losses from the incubation stage. Females paired to yearling males lost more mass than those paired to older males, although this effect was only detectable when nesting in high quality sites.

G.; TELLERÍA, J. L.",,"In this work we describe the composition and spatial organisation of the bird community inhabiting the hill tops of the Sierra de Chiribiquete (Colombia) at the end of the rainy season (November-December 1992). These hill tops are covered by a permanently open vegetation, and are located in the middle of an extensive tract of pristine Amazonian rainforest. We analysed the relationships between the composition and structure of' the bird community and the structure and floristic composition of the vegetation along a multivariate gradient of such characteristics. This gradient was established between the open shrubland which covered the hill tops and the tall dense shrubland which surrounded them. Finally, we also compared this bird community whith those described by other authors for a wide range of Neotropical habitats. Both bird abundance and species richness were lower in Chiribiquete than in other Neotropical localities. Dominance, however, was stronger in Chiribiquete due to the large abundance of an endemic species of hummingbird (Chlorostilbon olivaresi sp. nov.). Bird abundance and species richness increased from the surrounding dense shrublands to the open vegetation of the hill tops in a way that paralleled the increasing floristic and physiognomic diversity of the vegetation. The low bird abundance and species richness found in the open habitats of Chiribiquete appeared to be related to the scarcity of resources provided by the vegetation. This scarcity seems to be caused by the poor development of the soils due to the strong washing effect of tropical rains over the hill tops. On the other hand, the current insular character of these open habitats and their likely past connection with other open areas of the Amazonas and Orinoco basins would explain the originality of its bird community through processes of vicariance and speciation in situ. Few species of birds inhabiting the surrounding rainforest were found in the open hill tops although it may be possible that these rainforest species would seasonally use this open vegetation in response to probable increases of food resources along the dry season.",bird abundance; bird species richness; Amazonian rainforest; insularity; large permanent openings; vegetation structure.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/307.pdf,December 1995,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/422/articles/191-200/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main predator was the Montpellier snake Malpolon monspessulanus. Losses due to predation throughout the season ranged between 12% and 50% of the nests and predation increased until April, remaining at a constant level afterwards. The proportion of nestlings found dead in the nest increased through the season due to an increase in the number of chicks that died presenting the crop full of food. This suggests that other factors than food shortage (e. g. hyperthermia) must be the cause of the low breeding success at the end of the season.",breeding success; clutch size; hyperthermia; predation; Serinus serinus; starvation.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/287.pdf,June 1995,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/421/articles/1-10/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nineteen different nest sites are known, 11 of which are no longer occupied. The population during the 1950's was estimated to have been between 11 and 13 nesting pairs. Building new nests or rebuilding old abandoned ones has only been observed in pairs in their first or second breeding year. The present density of occupied nests is one for each 7.5 km of coastline, and one pair for each 1.1 km in the area of highest concentration. In 1990 an apparent recovery began following a period of eighth years of stability (1982-89). The average annual growth of the nesting population from 1980 to 1994 has been 8.8%. From two pairs in 1980 the number has increased to six pairs in 1994. The mean laying date was April 2; 51.6% of clutches were laid between 20 and 31 March. The earliest date was March 12, and the latest May 9. The first and second year pairs tended to lay later. The average size of the clutch was 2.88 eggs, this being normal for the subspecies haliaetus. The average productivity during these 15 years was 1.33 (fledged young/pair with clutch), oscillating between 0.33 and 2.25. The Menorca population has recovered with an average productivity of 1,00 young/pair with clutch between 1980 and 1987.

Arthropod availability was estimated by measuring the dry mass of arthropods in 900 small branches taken from trees. Quercus ilex branches had the largests arthropod abundances during the whole study period, and they were always positively selected by blue tits. The use of other tree species and foraging sites changed during the study period, as well as the availability of arthropods.

The Nuthatch (Sitta europaea; searcher on trunk and thick branches) and the Coal Tit (Parus ater; foliage gleaner) were used as focal species. The species studied adopted two different strategies while foraging at greater distances from cover: (1) the Nuthatch increased vigilance proportion (time spent vigilant per minute foraging), keeping the time spent at feeders constant, while (2) the Coal Tit decreased time spent at feeders, but showed no significant increase in vigilance proportion. The two components of vigilance (scanning rate and duration of individual scans) changed in different ways in the two species: the Nuthatch, which usually forages in open substrates, scanned more often, while the Coal Tit, which forages in substrates with denser vegetation cover, increased the length of scans (by reducing the proportion of short scans). These differences between vigilance patterns of both species are discussed in the light of differences related to the spatial configuration of the feeding niche (obstruction of visual space by vegetation) and the protection offered by the surroundings.",Parus ater; predation risk; scanning behaviour; spatial niche; Sitta europaea.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/292.pdf,June 1995,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/421/articles/49-56/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Correction factors for the digestibility of prey types were obtained by computing the number of recognizable prey items which appeared in the faeces of four captive adult blue tits fed with a mixture of intact individuals of five prey types. Comparisons of corrected and uncorrected estimates of diet composition suggest a serious underestimation of soft-bodied prey such as spiders and aphids in previous studies on Blue Tit diets. Corrected estimates showed that spiders were the most important prey in both adult and young birds' diets, followed by beetles and bugs (young birds) or aphids and larvae (adults). Selectivity of prey types was not much altered by the digestibility effect. Both age classes selected prey types on the basis of their energy content per gram of dry mass. These results were consistent with predictions from optimal diet models, bearing in mind that the small mean size of the prey types available would have implied small and similar handling times for all of them.",Blue Tit; Parus caeruleus; correction factors; diet; differential prey digestibility; prey selection.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/280.pdf,December 1994,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/412/articles/151-159/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A different distribution by age has been found depending on roost location: in September more yearlings are found in coastal (30.3%) than in inland (16.4%) roosts, but not during the other wintering months. Such a finding could be attributed to the fact that the studied area is a migratory stage towards the south of the Iberian Peninsula.

Males were mainly responsible for obtaining nest material, and during daylight they incubated and attended the nest more than females. Females incubated and attended the nests at night and fed the chicks at a higher rate than males. With the exception of nest building behaviour, these results were expected under the hypothesis that in colonial birds for which the risk of sperm competition is high, mating effort through extra-pair copulations has selected for higher parental contributions by males than by females to activities that do not require males to leave their nests, the sites where all copulations take place. By contrast, in those colonial species for which there is a low risk of sperm competition, mainly as a consequence of effective resistance by paired females during extra-pair copulation attempts (e. g. gulls and colonial raptors), the sexual patterns of nest attendance and chick feeding are the opposite to those described in the Spoonbill. This is probably the result of an early specialization, in the evolutionary history of these species, of males for gathering food for their mates during the prelaying and laying periods. This is a common feature in these species, that coevolved with the resistance of the paired females to extra-pair copulation attempts and, therefore, with the absence of sperm competition.",Doñana; parental roles; Platalea leucorodia; sperm competition; White Spoonbill.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/266.pdf,June 1994,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/411/articles/19-28/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chaffinch density was significantly lower in the pine wood than in the evergreen forest. In the pine wood chaffinches mainly foraged in the foliage, whereas in the evergreen forest foraging was restricted almost exclusively to the ground. Differences in food intake rate between habitats and substrates were directly associated with differences in population density and use of foraging substrates. These patterns of density variation and foraging behaviour in chaffinches were consistent with food availability (arthropod abundance and prey size). Our results support the hypothesis that food availability is very important in selection of habitat by passerines during the breeding season. The resource abundance hypothesis may represent an alternative view to the previously accepted hypothesis which supports that there has been competitive exclusion with the Blue Chaffinch (Fringilla teydea) to explain the between habitat distribution of the Common Chaffinch among islands.",Canarian Common Chaffinch; density; food availability; habitat distribution; habitat use.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/267.pdf,June 1994,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/411/articles/29-35/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

S.",,"The nestling growth of the Great Tit Parus major was studied in Sagunto, eastern Spain, by periodic weighting of individually marked nestlings in 24 successful first clutches. The logistic equation was used to model weight gain, and the growth constant (k) and the asymptote (A) computed, using an iterative least square fitting technique. The variability of these parameters was studied within broods, between broods, and between populations. Most clutches hatched asynchronously. Late-hatched young died more frequently than early-hatched ones. Those late-hatched young that survived grew at a lower rate than their early-hatched siblings, but reached the same asymptotic weight. Considering brood means as sample units, the relationships between some variables (including reproductive parameters and ambient temperatures during growth) and the nestling weight at different ages, growth rate, and asymptotic weight were analysed by stepwise multiple regression. Weights at days 0 and 4 were not significantly related to any studied variable. Weight at day 8 was negatively related to the number of hatchlings, and weights at 12 and 16 days were negatively related to the number of fledglings. The asymptotic weight was positively related to the mean egg volume, while the growth rate was negatively related to the clutch size. The partial regression coefficients of other variables were all non-significant after removing the effect of these factors. It is concluded that the mean asymptotic weight of a brood is mainly determined by the ""quality"" of the parents, while its mean growth rate is affected by sibling competition. Including only successfully fledged young, k was 0.39 g/day per g, and A was 17.86 g in the population of Sagunto. We compared the growth parameters of this and four other European Great Tit populations to examine the hypothesis that the growth rate is physiologically maximized and therefore does not vary geographically. We found significant differences in growth rate and asymptotic weight between the studied populations. These results do not support this hypothesis, suggesting that the nestling growth rate could vary between populations depending on the particular conditions in which they live.",asymptotic weight; eastern Spain; growth rate; nestlings; Parus major.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/256.pdf,December 1993,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/402/articles/121-131/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I suggest that late in the season parents hatch a relatively large brood because during the heterothermic stage nestlings will suffer lower heat losses in large than small broods, so that the time devoted to collecting food can be increased. Hatching asynchrony, then, ensures that last hatched young, that cannot be adequately fed, do not compete for food with their older siblings, thus reducing the nest period and predation risks of valuable nestlings. Evidence on seasonal variation of nest predation rates, fledging sizes and nestling feeding rates and attendance is given as a background to, but not as a formal test of, the hypothesis put forward.","brood heat loss; brood reduction; ""chick-heater""; hatching asynchrony; House Sparrow; nest predation.",,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/260.pdf,December 1993,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/402/articles/163-168/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The highest species richness and demographic stability were found in June, while winter brought both the lowest number of species and the lowest density. These two parameters, however, exhibited at that time great local variability mainly because of unequal spread of the three wintering species and the restrictive effect of snow ground cover. Early spring and fall were intermediate periods, when some long distance migrant birds arrived to the forest. Among resident species, there were several considered rare or with limited distribution in Spain (Capercaillie, Goshawk, Black Woodpecker, Marsh Tit, and Treecreeper). Average density of birds and biomass varied from 22 to 61.3 individuals per 10 ha (February and October) and from 0.47 to 3.43 Kg per 10 ha (February-March and October). Changes in these two parameters were parallel and independent of meteorological conditions, but the community's diversity was positively correlated with mild weather. The most abundant birds at any time were residents, and those weighting less than 25 g, with yearly mean densities of 86% and 90%, respectively. Some structural features of beech forests and other Iberian woodland bird communities were examined, raising the conclusion that although quantitative dominance of resident species is a common characteristic to all of them, it was specially intense in the beech forests, where changes in monthly density were, moreover, comparatively small. This fact might indicate a relatively rigid and compact structure of the bird community living in beech forests.",annual community; beech forests; censuses; community structure.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/244.pdf,June 1993,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/401/articles/1-11/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, 29 sectors were defined and the number of feeding birds of all species present counted several times during winter. At the same time, several habitat variables were measured, mainly related to substrate type and human presence. An overall positive association between species occurred. This showed that several species occurred together more often than expected by chance. Analysing patterns of covariation, it was found that two main groups of species had a similar utilisation of sectors; these were (1) Black-headed Gull (Larus ridibundus), Lesser Black-backed Gull (Larus fuscus), Sanderling (Calidris alba), Turnstone (Arenaria interpres), Oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) and Ringed Plover (Charadrius hiaticula), and (2) all other species, although some subgroups could be considered to exist. All significant correlations between species abundances were positive. This suggested that strong competition for space did not occur or the spatial scale of analysis was not fine enough to detect competition processes. Five groups of sectors with similar bird assemblage structure were identified by cluster analysis. Sectors within each one of these groups had in common the most abundant species and the five dominant species were Dunlin, Avocet, Redshank, Lesser Black-backed Gull and Black-headed Gull. Nevertheless, a great structural variability inside each group was found and their location in an ordination space showed that they were not individual entities but parts of a gradient. Sediment type explained the distribution of the several assemblage types throughout the estuary. Sectors dominated by Lesser Black-backed Gull occurred near to the mouth of the estuary or in the main river. Assemblages dominated by Dunlin, Avocet and Black-headed Gull seemed to represent to various degrees a gradient in sediment type.

Patterns of shape variation revealed differences among the species showing a gradient from species with relatively long legs and pelvis to species having short legs and wide pelvis.

This can induce changes in some features of the species life strategies, from the diet itself to the time and energy devoted to foraging. When the availability of other kinds of food is low, the survival rates, specially in preadult stages, can artificially increase. These hypotheses are supported by numerous circumstantial evidences, found in studies over a wide range of birds. Nevertheless, many different situations can arise depending on the variable local conditions of each population. Before promoting conservation measures involving the setting up of new predictable food sources (like “vulture-restaurants”), it must be first clearly stablished which species are intended to encourage, if the status of their populations really demand this kind of investment, and if a positive impact can be expected in view of the species biology and the framework of local conditions. On the other hand, the possible negative effects derived from the likely population increase of other species without conservation interest, must be taken into account. Finally, on the opposite side there seems to be a pressing need for evaluating the effects that the progressive elimination of refuse dumps in Spain could have on the populations of some threatened species (like Lammergeier, Black Vulture and Red Kite).",Aves; basureros; buires; conservación; España; fuentes de alimentación; gaviotas; milanos; muladares.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1375.pdf,December 1992,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/392/articles/29-40/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data coming from the inspection of regurgitated food boluses collected in the breeding colonies are grouped according to taxonomic, typologic and biomass criteria, in order to analyze the importance of the different prey items, either from the ecological interaction (number) or from the energy supply (biomass) perspectives. We found that coleoptera and cyprinid fishes are the main prey items in our analysis. The former, mainly big larvae of Hydrous piceus, are easier to catch than the latter, but offer, on average, lower gain per item than fishes. It can be considered that coleoptera, the staple food, are eaten while Night Herons are standing for the capture of fishes, which are more difficult and more profitable prey items. When comparing the results from 1990 with those of 1991, it stands out that coleoptera and cyprinid fishes were more available in 1990 than in 1991. In this latter year they were partially substituted by ducklings and other chicks, crustacea and other complementary prey items. The comparison of trophic niche width and diet composition of Night Herons in the Ebro Delta with several other localities shows that values reached in the Ebro Delta are very similar to those obtained in Camargue and other European localities.

No clear relationship between prey size and phenology was found, although older chicks received a greater quantity of large prey.

Three hundred twenty two records, referred to 2,860 birds have been obtained, mainly from 1975 onwards. The Snow Bunting is a regular migrant and winter visitor, at least in NW Spain (Cantabria, Asturias and Galicia) and probably in Catalonia, though in rather low numbers. Nevertheless, they seem to use the most preferred habitats (sand-dune beaches, coastal heathlands in the top of cliffs) in a spatially and temporarily irregular fashion, the number of overwintering birds fluctuating extensively between years. At least three stretches of coastime have regularly been used during the last two decades: Bergantiños and Ferrol regions (the most outstanding sites being Baldaio and A Frouxeira beaches), both in La Coruña (Galicia), and Avilés-Gijón (Asturias); the migrating and overwintering populations ranging daily from 1 to 50 birds per site, with a exceptional count of ca. 100 at Baldaio in November 1975. During autumn (September-November) the species seems to be much more distributed all along the coast, with some records from inland. The spring observations (March-May) are scarce and restricted to Galicia. There is a neat numerical preponderance of females and/or first-winter birds over males (second winter or older). The populations studied in Galicia are highly gregarious, the flocks of each locality usually joining together in one, nearly always monospecific, flock. The large numerical variations from winter to winter and the lack of careful observations of extensive areas prevents to assess the amount of the overwintering population, but, only for Galician beaches, it seems reasonable to estimate it, depending on the years, in 50-200 birds. These figures are of roughly the same magnitude of those reported for Brittany or Ireland.",distribution; flock size; fluctuations; habitats; Iberian Peninsula; phenology; Plectrophenax nivalis; population structure; sociability.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1383.pdf,December 1991,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/382/articles/179-198/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The censuses were carried out using the transect method in spring (May-June) and winter (December-February) in the years 1987-1989. The altitude is an important factor in the bird community organization, with additional effects derived of the different vegetation physiognomies. The influence of the altitude is slighter in spring, but very outstanding during the winter, specially on species richness. In the latter period a great number of birds disappear from the high and mid-mountain habitats without a remarkable wintering, long-distance migrants being an important part of the breeding community. On the other hand, the low latitude habitats are important wintering quarters for many birds that acid up to the residents, the transaharian fraction being much smaller. So, there are two kinds of seasonality in these mountains. A summer seasonality which peaks in the montane shrublands, with many summer migrants that are not replaced in winter; and a winter seasonality, characteristic of the mediterranean habitats which are occupied in winter by a great number of birds absent in spring. The most stable habitats from an ornithological point of view are the mid-altitude forests. The reduced proportion of long-distance migrants in the pine-woods and the relatively low seasonality of these habitats are discussed. The patterns in seasonality and the abundance of transaharian migrants in Gredos seem to obey more to purely bioclimatic factors (productivity) than to physiognomical ones (vegetation structure), and they fit well to the «bottleneck hypothesis» (relative productivity differences between seasons).",bird communities; mountains; seasonality; Sierra de Gredos (Central Spain); transaharian migrants; wintering.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/215.pdf,December 1991,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/382/articles/207-231/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

L.; GALARZA, A.",,"The wintering bird community in the Eucalyptus globulus plantation of Arminza (Vizcaya) was studied during two consecutive winters. During the mild winter of 1989-1990, around 39 birds/10 ha were counted in this plantation. A half of these birds (21 birds/10 ha) fed on eucalypt trees. The main substrata they used were flowers (53,5 % of birds feeding on the eucalypt trees), sprouts of growing leaves (26,9 %) and capsules (13,7 %). The remaining substrata showed minor importance as feeding places: trunks (0,6 %), branches over 5 cm diameter (0 %), branches of 1-5 cm diameter (0,9 %) and developed leaves twigs under 1 cm (4,4%). This unbalanced distribution of birds on the Eucalypt trees was related to the food distribution. Flowers had many invertebrates (mainly Tysanoptera and Diptera) and nectar, both foods being useful resources for several species (Sylvia atricapilla, Phylloscopus collybita, Parus caeruleus and Parus major). The sprouts of growing leaves, infested by bugs (Homoptera), were mainly used by Regulus ignicapillus and the seeds in Eucalypt capsules were exploited by Carduelis spinus, Parus major and P. ater. During the cold winter of 1900-1991, eucalypt trees did not flourish and bugs vanished. This decrease in food resources was related to the sharp decrease in the abundance of the wintering avifauna (9 birds/10 ha).",eucalyptus plantation; food availability; wintering avifauna; Northern Spain.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/217.pdf,December 1991,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/382/articles/239-247/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The food of young herons in Extremadura differs from other localities in which comsumption of amphibia is more marked. This small comsumption of amphibia is possibly due to their absence in the Guadiana river, due in turn to the fact that they have been decimated by different species of introduced fish.

This size-selection and the observation of a lack of predation on other medium or big-sized snail species frequent in the area (Sphinterochila candidisima and Iberus alonensis) seem to support the idea that selective feeding responds to shell hardness.

The results suggest birds choose hunting method according to the principIe of energy minimization (Masman et al., 1988a). Hunting method selection is determined by energy demand, available time of foraging and net energy associated to each method. Time of foraging seems to be limited by environmental conditions. During midday (11-14 h. s.), negative correlations existed between temperature and time of foraging (Fig. 2). Net energy depends on available prey. Changes in hunting methods during day (Fig. 1) suggest birds used flight-hunting («cernido» and «cicleo») in hours with greatest availability of prey (Fig. 3); in this manner they increase net energy associated to these methods. Variation in daily energy budget (Table 3) shows two periods of gain energy; one in the first week of August which could be associated to recovery of energy spent in breeding, and other in September which could be associated to migration.",Falco naumanni; premigration; activity; hunting method slection; energy budget.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/1386.pdf,December 1990,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/372/articles/163-178/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of these farmlands to produce cheap wood by means of pine and eucalyptus reafforestations has been suggested as an alternative use of this area. In spite of the importance of this potential landscape remodelation, few studies have been devoted to predict its impact on wildlife. This work studies the breeding and wintering bird communities in farmlands, Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus globulus plantations of the Basque Country and Cantabria in order to predict the impact on birds of this future economical policy. Broadleaved natural forests (a mixture of Fagus sylvatica and Quercus spp.) are also studied to compare their bird communities with those occupying the exotic tree plantations. Results show that farmlands are the habitat with the highest richness of breeding birds, the broadleaved forests being the second one in this ranking. Farmlands are also the habitat with highest densities of summer migrants. Eucalyptus globulus plantations are the poorest habitat for birds. 36 % and 6 % of the bird species recorded are concentrated in farmlands and broadleaved forests. However, none species use pine or eucalyptus plantations as their exclusive breeding habitat. During winter, farmlands continue to be the exclusive habitat for 38 % of species, with the highest densities of wintering birds. Broadleaved forests and pine plantations show intermediate scores whilst eucalyptus plantations are again the. poorest habitat. We conclude that the avifauna of these pine an eucalyptus plantations is a poor and biased sample of the primitive forest bird fauna. A sharp increase of surface occupied by these tree plantations, and the related decrease of farmlands, will suppose an important impoverishment of the breeding and wintering avifauna of this region. According to the importance of farmlands as breeding and wintering grounds of many foreing birds, this landscape modification could also affect the avifauna of other countries.",bird communities; breeding avifauna; conservation; Eucalyptus globulus; farmland; landscape management; Northern Spain; Pinus radiata; reafforestation; wintering avifauna.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/188.pdf,December 1990,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/372/articles/229-245/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four species (Sitta europaea, Parus major, P. caeruleus and P. palustris) decrease or dissapear in these plantations while other eight species show an increase (Dendrocopos major, Prunella modularis, Phylloscopus collybita, Regulus ignicapillus, Parus ater, P. cristatus, Troglodytes troglodytes y Fringilla coelebs). The breeding avifauna of the plantations of Pinus radiata is richer in species and denser, but less diversified than the one inhabiting broadleaved forests. The height of timber, the number of tree species and the bush cover increase the density and richness of the breeding avifauna of the plantations. Therefore, plots of bushes and growing broadleaved trees should be protected within these reaforestations. Density and richness increase along the development stage of plantations. However, dominance decreases during the first years, probably due to the ecotonic features of young plantations (time ecotone). The plantations of Pinus radiata promote fast development of forest bird communities, but their early logging (around 20 years from planting) avoids these woodlands to support most of the more specialized forest birdsof the Basque Country.",forest birds; North of Spain; plantations of Pinus radiata; habitat preferences; forestry; succession.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/189.pdf,December 1990,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/372/articles/247-266/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of more than 25.000 gulls of 10 species was censused, the five most common being L. ridibundus (49.95 %), L. fuscus (27.98 %), L. cachinnans (15.13 %), L. melanocephalus (4.68 %) and L. audouinii (2.2 %). The remaining five species recorded were either rare or vagrant. The relative passage periods were established for each species and also differences and coincidences in age group passage, as well as relative abundance. The volume of westerly passage of L. cachinnans between April and August goes against the normal N-NW movement known for this species from the NW Mediterranean. It is suggested that the prolonged autumn passage of L. melanocephalus is because of the involvement of the distinct populations which exist between the Camargue and the Black Sea. The considerable numerical increase of L. audouinii was noted although, except for changes in age group composition, there is little change in the overall pattern of post-breeding migration.",gulls; populations; migration; Malaga.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/171.pdf,June 1990,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/371/articles/19-27/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J.",,"During three years, we recorded the measurements of 11 variables in 98 nests. We studied not only the usual variables: body, tarsal, culmen, wing, tail and weigth, but also three rarely considered: the buccal commissure length, buccal cavity width and the height of the two buccal commissures (we refer to these variables as «nestling charasteristics» because they tend to disappear in the adults). We also recorded the daily changes in the morphology variation. The chicks gain weight quickly until they reach the l6th day. Brood size does not affect the weight rate significantly; however, as brood size increases, the asymptote decreases. The nestling characteristics grow very quickly during the first 13 days, and then gradually decrease. The tarsal length is similar to that of adults on the 1 8th day. The wing and tail lengths show a quick growth after their feathers begin to grow, usually days 11, 12 and 13. The eyes beguin opening on the 8th day and they are completely open in 90% of the nestlings on the l4th day. Some nestlings leave the nest with lower weight, and lesser body, wing and tail lengths. These chicks cannot fly up to the trees, therefore they remain on the ground, and have a high mortality rate. Our data agree with the adaptive growth hypothesis. The growth of Jackdaw nestlings goes trough two different stages both relating to begging behaviour. In the first stage, the weight, tarsal length and the nestling charasteristics grow very quickly, and coincide with a quite passive begging behaviour; that is the nestling raise the head and neck upwards with the mouth open, being the parents who choose the distribution of the food. This begging behaviour changes as a consequence of an important development in the tarsal length and the weight, and because the eyes open. From this moment, begging behaviour is more active; the nestling may direct their head to the parents beak. In this second stage, the nestling charasteristics decrease and the wing and tail lengths begin to grow quickly.",Corvus monedula; avian reproduction; growth rate; brood size; adaptive growth hypothesis; begging behaviour; Southern Spain.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/173.pdf,June 1990,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/371/articles/37-52/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of the migrants belong to the subspecies flava, the subspecies composition remaining seemingly unchanged throughout the migration period. The passage is very rapid and most birds seem to get out to sea after crossing over the northern half of the Mediterranean coast. Although in average juveniles begin the migration before than adults, they are also slower. Within each sex, juveniles show mean values of wing measurements, weight and fat storage significantly smaller than those of adults. Later migrants have higher mean weights and accumulate more fat. About 12 % of the body weight is lost every night. Individual birds attain maximal fat storage before entering Iberia, and they maintain these reserves throughout the whole migration.

Despite this dífference in food availability, there were no significant differences between both tree species in the residence times, intake (pecking) rates or distances flown to reach them. The observed similarity of foraging behaviour is seemingly attained by concentrating the searching activity on the substrate with highest food availability (lichen and moss patches). Nevertheless, travelling speed (hopping rate) is higher on beeches, since the birds are obligated to go across the unproductive bare trunk surfaces (which account for a larger proportion of the total tree surface in the case of beeches) in the shortest possible time. In addition, brown treecreepers tend to minimize the distance flown from one oak to another. The observed utilization of beeches and oaks does not differ significantly from the one that would be expected taking into account the densities of both types of trees, their respective values of food availability and the travelling costs within each tree species.",Certhia brachydactyla; optimal foraging; tree species selection; winter.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/156.pdf,December 1989,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/362/articles/149-160/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Variation in body condition (body weight and fat accumulation) among ringed birds was studied in relation to variation in diet, particularly fruit consumption. Vegetable matter, the fleshy fruits of nine species, supplemented with acorn endosperm in December and January, averaged 67.2 %, 77.5 % and 53.1 % of diet volume in three consecutive wintering seasons (1980-1981, 1981-1982 and 1982-1983). Fruits of Pistacia lentiscus (Anacardiaceae) were the most important component of this vegetable diet. On average, arthropod prey contributed no less than 23 % to the diet volume. In any wintering season, at least 89 % of individual diet samples contained fleshy fruits and not more than 10 % contained only animal prey. There were significant among-year differences in the proportion of Robins with «frugivorous» diets (> 70 % made up by fruits). On a seasonal basis, the proportion of wintering individuals consuming «frugivorous» diets was significantly correlated with fruit availability. The monthly averages of fruit volume in the diet varied inversely with arthropod abundance; arthropod prey increased in importance in the diet from December until the spring, when fruit availability decreased and insects become abundant. Non-parametric, partial correlations suggested that the seasonal increase in reliance on fruit food was a response to increased fruit availability rather than to a decrease in arthropod abundance. Among years, diet variation did not closely match variation in fruit availability, but differences in consumption of particular species reflected their annual differences in fruiting intensity. There was a significant concordance between the rankings of fruit species in the Robin's diet and those relative to the overall fruit production in the habitat; this overall concordance was consistent among seasons. Individual Robins showing different levels of fruit consumption did not show significant differences, in body weight or fat accumulation. Relationships between diet variation and body condition were examined for a number of recaptured individuals with multiple regression, using fruit consumption, initial body weight and fat accumulation level, and ambient temperature and rainfall as the independent variables. Most of the variation in body condition was accounted for by the initial weight and fat accumulation and by the ambient temperature during the period previous to the capture. Body condition varied independently of diet type. Higher initial weights and fat leveis, and higher average temperatures during the days previous to the capture, resulted in smaller relative increases in these measures of body condition. In contrast, both body weight and fat accumulation varied inversely with the average minimum temperature during this period.",diet; seed dispersal; wintering; mediterranean scrubland; Erithacus; frugivory; body weight.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/157.pdf,December 1989,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/362/articles/161-183/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 23.7 % of nests, all the eggs laid were lost, in 10 of those before clutches are finished. 29% of the eggs laid never hatched, the average (+ SD) value for accounting for the eggs lost per clutch being 1,52+0,15. No significant differences have been detected neither among colonies nor among years. No significant correlation has been found between the 1055 of eggs and the clutch size. Neither there exists clear correlation with respect to laying time, which only turns out to be significant if the number of cases where all the eggs laid lost is considered. For the females that breed for the first time, the reproductive failure rate is considerably higher than for the more experienced females. The principal causes of egg losses are predation carried out by Corvus corax (36,5 %) and intraespecific interferences (23,9 %). Other possible factors responsible for egg losses are subject to detailed analysis. In 23.8 % of the nests ah the chicks died and in 70.8 % of them partial losses were recorded. 62.8 % of chicks that are born die, the average (+ SD) mortality rate per nest being 2.9 + 0.12. Except in one case, no significant differences have been found among zones. However, differences have been found among years, surely due to yearly climatic variations, which was verified upon finding a significant correlation between distinct climatic parameters and the death rate of chicks. There is no correlation between chicks mortality and laying time, althoug there is a significant correlation clutch size: the longer this is, the higher the death rate. The majority of the chicks (78,0 %) die of starvation, almost 50 % dying before they are 5 days old.

On average, the individuals coming from more Northern breeding areas are the first to cross, birds from more Southern populations crossing successively. The tail end of this migration includes a very high percentage of juveniles. Activity reaches a peak at about two-four hours after sunrise and then falls consistently all through the day. Every night, the migration is undertaken again after sunset; resting periods do not seem to last more than one day. These resting periods are apparently not associated with weight increases, though this might be due to a lack of accuracy in the method employed. During the European passage, fat storage is restricted to the quantity needed to meet the requirements of short flight journeys, thus avoiding overloads. Nevertheless, fat storage increases over the Iberian Mediterranean coasts, in order to cross the sea and, furthermore, to have enough stored energy to fly over the Sahara. Birds migrating through the Mediterranean islands begin to accumulate fat in more Northern latitudes than coast migratory birds. In both cases, it is likely that fat storage continues until the birds reach the Saharan edges.",Philloscopus trochilus; postnuptial migration; West Mediterranean.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/146.pdf,June 1989,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/361/articles/61-71/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fact that most of the invertebrate prey recorded belong to ground-dwelling groups, together with the observation that Redwings mostly forage for fallen fruits, suggests that the species is predominantly a ground forager at the study area.

The migrants do not fly directly but migrate first to the SW. If they continued in this direction, they would fly out over the Atlantic. To find out where the birds change their direction and which factors might control the change, radar observations were carried out in Beja, situated in southern Portugal. The results demonstrate that the change of direction to the SE did not take place, and the birds still kept a southwesterly direction. A comparison of the directions of migration in Europe show that most birds change their directions already within Europe. If they maintain the directions observed in Beja, on average the migrants will have a sea-crossing of about 1000 km till they arrive on the African coast or on the Canary Islands. The prevailing northerly winds will reduce the crossing-time. The presence of huge colonies of Eleonora's falcons on the Moroccan coast and on the Canary Islands demonstrate that a regular crossing over the Atlantic takes place. Maintaining their average direction they will follow a migration path near the coast until Mauritania, where a shiff to a more southerly direction would be necessary to keep in contact to land. After having passed the Sahara at its western border the migrants will reach most wintering quarters by a further shift of direction to the east. This coastal route has the advantage that the migrants pass the Sahara in one of its ecologically best areas, that it leads to the important wintering quarters of West Africa and that migrants wintering further in the E and SE can make stops in ecologically rich habitats. Thus, the change of direction, supposed in the area of SW-Europe and N-Africa, takes place about 2000 km further to the south.",autumn migration; radar observations; Southern Portugal; transsaharian passerines.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/131.pdf,December 1988,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/352/articles/221-232/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For each cliff 18 variables were quantified evaluating habitat humanisation, physiography and prey availability. In the mountains, B. bubo distribution seems to be limited by rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) availability and the owl has disappeared from some areas owing to the myxomatosis that decimated rabbits.

Three different morphological patterns have been found: sterna having spina externa and spina interna; sterna having spina externa and ligamentum internospinale, this occuping the same position as the spina interna when it is present; and sterna having only spina externa.

It seems always to be present in P. domesticus, P. hispaniolensis and F. montifringilla, and might be in P. coronata, the rest of the species having intraspecific variability. Using the out-group comparison criteria for determining the polarity of evolutionary change in an evolving character, presence of spina interna is the primitive character state and its absence is the derived state.

A 76,4 % of the clutchs originates fledged young. The number of fledglings in successful nests is 1,32. The number of fledgling chicks by pair is 0,81 (n = 117). Significant variations in the reproductive success with regard to variations on the feeding and nest-density of Egyptian Vultures was not found. A significant decrease in the productivity in 1984 with regard to 1983 was registered coincident with a highly rainy spring. Losses in the nests occurs mainly during the incubation and the first weeks of the chickens growth. The reproductive success is relatively low in Navarra when compared to other zones of Europe, specially in comparison with the arid regions of the Low Ebro Valley (Northeast of Spain) where the highest know reproductive rate for this species is reached.",breeding rates; diet; Neophron percnopterus; Spain.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/111.pdf,June 1988,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/351/articles/3-14/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The method has been used to analyse the recent changes for all European (and separately for Finnish) breeding birds. Some illustrative examples from these two surveys are presented. The method, its advantages and its sources of error are described in detail. For the species wintering in Finland, the patterns obtained in the questionnaire survey were in good agreement with those shown by means of the winter bird censuses during the same period. The results from the surveys for Europe and Finland are compared. The clearest difference is the much higher proportion of species increasing in numbers in Finland compared with the whole of Europe (28.4% versus 19.4%). The trends in different orders show several striking differences between the two areas. This questionnaire method is recommended for use in other European countries, especially those where more advanced monitoring programmes are not in operation.",bird species; Europe; Finland; monitoring; number trends; questionnaires; range trends.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/112.pdf,June 1988,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/351/articles/15-30/,,,,,,,,,, English,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J.; BLANCO, D.",,"Laying dates, clutch size, hatching asynchrony and breeding success across two breeding seasons are reported for a population of Blue Tits, a montane (1.300-1.400 m. a. s. l.) deciduous oak (Quercus pyrenaica) forest in central Spain. Blue Tits raised a single brood in each breeding season. The breeding season of the first study year (1984) was much delayed when compared to that in 1985 (Table 1), this being due to inusual hard snowstorm conditions in May 1984. Clutch size ranged between 2 and 11, 7,7 being the average figure for the two years combined. There was seasonal decline in clutch size (Fig. 1). Nestling mortality due to starvation was significantly higher in 1984 than 1985 (Table II). In the former year the commonest clutch size was 8, and the most productive clutch size was 7, while in 1985 the commonest clutch size (9) was conservative with regard to the most productive (10) (Table III). Hatching asynchrony was quantified by means of two different criteria for the 1985 breeding season. We found that hatching asynchrony increased as the season progressed (Fig. 2). Data on the clutch size of the Blue Tit in other Spanish areas are extracted both from the literature and from nest-record cards in the Sociedad Española de Ornitología (S. E. O.) (Table IV). Though the data are few, there seems to exist much variation in clutch size linked to the position of the areas in the bioclimatic gradient of the Iberian Peninsula, no consistent trends emerging when examining this variation under Ashmole's hypothesis. We suggest that latitudinal and elevational gradients in clutch size may be confounded by a non monotonous geographical variation of environmental and ecological parameters along these gradients. Hence, clutch size may be higher in middle elevations and/or latitudes, at least in the diversified Mediterranean landscapes.",altitude; clutch size; hatching asynchrony; Parus caeruleus; Spain.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/113.pdf,June 1988,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/351/articles/31-43/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The morphological organization of the community shows strong seasonal variations at the level of species packing. The nesting communities are structured, in their simplest configuration, by a central core of species poorly differenciated morphologically. Communities which show a greater number of species have also the largest morphological space, since the majority of the new species incorporated to those communities are located at the outlayers of the morfological space. This pattern is common with another nesting communities of similar habitats.

The PCA applied to the 19 samples studied arrange them along a bioclimatic gradient, characterized by four of the six variables considered. The proportion of Mus spretus captured by the owls increases in parallel with the overall number of small mammals included in their diet. That trend shows a large dependence on a bioclimatic or latitudinal gradient and seems to be related to the existence of ecological optimums forming a patchy system. In the same way, the general prevalence of M. spretus in the diet of Barn Owl is definitely established. The seasonal analysis indicates that the Barn Owl only selects mice in spring, when the youngs of M. spretus seem to be of difficult access for the predator, although they constitute the most abundant group in the traps. The numbers of mice with bone deformities is significantly greater in the pellets than in the traps.

M.",,"This paper examines the composition and structure of the breeding bird community inhabiting the conifer plantations (Pinus canariensis and Pinus radiata) of Tenerife (Canary Islands). The bird community is dominated by Parus caeruleus, Regulus regulus, Phylloscopus collybila, Erithacus rubecula, Fringilla teydea and Turdus merula (table I). As an overall pattern, pine afforestations originates suitable habitats for the recovery of the forest avifauna of the conifer woods in the Canary Islands, Dendrocopos major being the only species that still has not colonized them. Density and hird species richness is inversely related both with the altitude of afforestation and with physical variables. r´D/S: partial correlation between each variable and D rernaving the effect of S. Density is strongly correlated with bird richness; when the richness effect is removed bird density only relates to altitude. Tables V, VI and VII show habitat selection of the six most abundant bird species. Stem density is inversely correlated with the abundance of each species. Shrub cover and altitude are the most powerful variables discriminating the bird species habitat selection. However, there are strong interspecific overlaps in habitat selection (Figure 3 and table V). The density of each species is partially determined by the availability of its prefered habitat (Figure 2). There are no negative correlations among species densities, positive correlations being the rule even when the species-specific habitat selection is removed (table VIII). Density and species richness in Pinus radiata afforestations are higher than those in the Pinus canariensis forests. These differences are attributable to diferences in vegetation structure (tables IX and X). Defoliation of Pinus canariensis forests by Dasychagra fortunata (Lepidoptera) only affects negatively to Regulus regulus (pine foliage searcher) density (tables XI and XII). The pattern of bird community structure is related to the vegetation structure of the Canary Islands pinewoods is very similar to that observed in the continental Pinus radiata plantations in the Atlantic Basque Country, Spain (table XIII). The lower density and species richness of the afforestations in Tenerife is explained by the effect of insularity, distance from the core conifer forests avifauna of the Western Palearctic and differences in vegetation structure.",bird communities; Canary Islands; competition; habitat selection; insect forest pest; pine afforestations; vegetation structure.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/107.pdf,December 1987,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/342/articles/193-224/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

M.",,"The migration of wintering Common Snipe in the Iberian Peninsula is examined by using 509 recovery cards (see table 1). The origins of recovered birds can be ascribed to two migratory fronts. The first one begins in Fennoscandia and spans all the continental Atlantic European countries, its wintering area being mainly the Cantabrian and Atlantic Iberian coasts. The second group traverses all central Europe to enter Spain via southeast France and mainly winters in the northern half of the Mediterranean Spanish coast. Birds ringed in northern Europe have a more uniform distribution across Iberia. Both migratory flows become more independent as they proceed on their way (Figure 2). The wintering distribution of the species in the Iberian Peninsula (Figure 1) is therefore mainly coastal, though there are no wintering recoveries in the xeric southeast nor in the Balearic Islands. Inside the Spanish mainland only Extremadura accounts for a high number of recoveries of ringed birds. Arrival of Common Snipe begins in September and the departures in March, the highest numbers being recorded in December (Figure 3). No phenological variations across the area could be detected (Figure 4). Young birds arrive before adults on average (Figure 5), but distribution is not age-dependent. The average migration speed is 100 km/day. The demography of the wintering population is analyzed (Table 3 and Figure 6). 63 % of the wintering birds were in their first year. The mortality rate is very high during the first two years of life (70 %) and decreases to a minimum (12 %) in the third year, then increasing again.

In the analysis of the different factors that can affect laying time in this species, we have obtained: (1) food availability has little influence, (2) latitude is correlated with laying date, but has no influence on our results, which is in agreement with BAKER (1938) theory, (3) daylight is one of the most important factors, (4) significant correlations between the temperatures of march-april and the laying time, as well as between the temperatures of March and laying synchronism have been found, (5) age of female affects phenology: younger females lay later.",Corvus monedula; laying phenology; Spain.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/92.pdf,June 1987,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/341/articles/3-14/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

H.",,"From 1976 to 1985 up to 3.528 Audouin´s Gulls Larus auidouinii were ringed at the Chafarinas Islands breeding colony. In this paper we present and discuss the spatial and temporal distribution of the 20 recoveries and 34 reports of colour-marked birds obtained so far. The winterquarters are apparently along the Atlantic coast of Northwest Africa. Recoveries reach Mauritania (1) and Senegal (2) countries where rarely this species has ever been reported. Our data suggest that the main winter area must be on the Canary Current, between Rio de oro and Senegal, the absence of previous information being due to a lack of adequate surveys. A minor part of the population spend the winter on the Mediterranean coast of Africa, all the recoveries or sightings coming so far from Morocco. Inside it adults are dominant and first winter birds seem to be absent, probably near all of them having migrated to the Atlantic. Birds colour-marked at the Chafarinas have often been reported from the Spanish side of the Strait of Gibraltar during the autumn passage, which extends from July to November. First year birds migrate earlier on average, being mainly seen in August. Very few data relate to the prebreeding passage (from February to April). Some immatures spend the summer months in the Atlantic winterquarters (as shown by June recoveries from Mauritania and Senegal), but some others move to the Mediterranean already in the year after birth.

Six species of passerines visit the plants and feed on the fruits. Turdus merula is the most common visitor, 85 % of its faecal samples containing remains of Ivy fruits. Erithacus rubecula and Sylvia atricapilla are the next species in the visitation and consumption rates. The average length of feeding visits were 0,85+0,50 min, for the whole frugivore set. A greater frequency of feeding visits implicates a greater total time in the plant and both more fruit consumed and seeds removed. Turdus merula and Erithacus rubecula are the species which stay for a longer time in the plants and therefore the only species which drop Ivy seeds beneath the plants (regurgitated, defecated or fallen during fruit manipulation): T. merula 7,9 % and E. rubecula 6,7 % of the total seeds removed; however, Blackbirds and Robins are the main seed dispersers in the study site.

A.; LUCIENTES, J.; FERRER, X.",,"The extent to which Red-crested Pochards engage in moult migration varies among different Iberian localities, probably depending on environmental conditions. In the regions where water levels drastically fall during summer (e. g. Andalusia, S. Spain), all individuals undertake the moult migration. In these regions male departure takes place earlier than that of females; when spring water levels are low, most individuals do not attempt breeding, and then both sexes initiate earlier the moult migration than when water levels are high, in these years the males also starting earlier the moult of contour feathers than in years when they breed. In the regions where summer variations of water levels are not so pronounced (e. g. Ebro Delta, NE Spain), most males leave the breeding grounds to moult the remiges elsewhere, whereas females moult in the breeding areas. Both the number of individuals and the proportion of males moulting in Gallocanta Lagoon (one of the most important moulting localities for the species) varied between years.

The relative importance of fruit varies widely between species, either in their frequency of occurrence in the faeces (0.0-92.9 %) or in the percent volume (0.0-48.2 %). The number of fruit species consumed is closely related to the degree of frugivory and this seems to be a general relation when considering the number of fruit species recorded for each bird species in a wide geographical area (Appendix). Thus, most species rely on the sporadic consumption of 1 or 2 fruit species that contribute a minor fraction to the diet. In a comparison of data obtained in two consecutive years, fruit consumption increased in the second year probably as a response to a parallel ten-fold increase in the fruit supply and a decrease in arthropod abundance. This, together with the fact that the fruit species consumed are those reaching the highest abundances in the area, points to an opportunistic use of fruits by these birds. As shown by a stepwise, multiple correlation analysis, only wing and culmen-length (to cranium) explain a significant proportion of the between-species variance in frugivory. Wing-length indicates a size factor, being positively related to frugivory. Bill-length is negatively correlated, indicating that species with relatively long, pointed bills, may have more difficulty in taking, seizing, and mandibulating fruits prior to ingestion than those with shorter bills and wider gapes. Additionally, differences in dependence on fruit food between these species and Sylvia spp., Turdus spp., and other frugivorous genera seem to be related to differences in digestive physiology.",ecomorphology; feeding habits; frugivory; Muscicapidae; seed dispersal.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/98.pdf,June 1987,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/341/articles/89-98/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both types of materials were collected in several localities from southern Spain, mostly in the province of Málaga. On the basis of the high correlation between Mandibular Length (LM) with Head and Body Length (CC) and Weight (P), the parameter LM was chosen in order to infer the size of the rats captured by owls (Table 1). The results revealed that, whereas B. bubo does not select its prey according to their size, T. alba, contrarily, prey only on young rats (Fig. 1).

In winter (Table I) both species are mainly granivorous whereas, in spring, there is a great amount of animal food in their diet, specially in that of the House Sparrow. From the vegetable items, cereal seeds are rarely taken by Tree Sparrows whereas they represent an important fraction of the diet of House Sparrows. Likewise, biomass ingested is mainly of vegetable origin in both bird species but it is based mainly on wild seeds for Tree Sparrows, while for House Sparrows it is based chiefly on wheat (table IV). Quantitative overlap among the diets of the two sparrows (Table II), computed on the number of ingested items, is normally low, except in winter due to the high consuming of Amarantus albus. When computed on the biomass supplied by each category, overlap is very low due to the high preponderance of wheat in the diet of Passer domesticus. Qualitative overlap (Table II) is small and again highest in winter. The diversity of ingested items is greater for Passer domesticus in winter and for Passer montanus in spring, but when computed on the dry weight it is always greater for Passer montanus, particularly in spring (Table III). Differences in the body size of the two species as well as inter-habitat segregation can be the main causes of the observed differences in their diets.

The Coot spent most of the diurnal hours feeding and resting mainly during the night. Most individuals grazed on pastures of Eleocharis acicularis and Baldellia ranunculoides, and only a small proportion of the population fed in water, mainly by diving (tab. 1 & 2). These foraging and activity patterns are considered to be a consequence of the species low digestive efficiency, the energetic cost of the foraging methods used, and the need to acumulate fat in order to face the winter severity. Circadian and spatial variations of activity patterns, foraging methods in water, and horizontal distribution of the birds were also analyzed (figs. 1-4). During the afternoon the foraging rate decreased and the birds partially left the pastures. At distances over 25 m from the shore, the birds showed lower foraging rates, devoted more time to comfort activities, and when they foraged, diving was the main feeding method. Both, general activities and foraging methods in water had greater variations in space than in time (table 3). Finally, management techniques are proposed.

M.",,"The results of this first winter survey of gulls and terns, which was jointly organized by the Iberian Seabird Group, the Spanish ornithological Society, CODA- ICBP Spain, and CEMPA -Secretaria de Estado do Ambiente-, are presented and dicussed in this study. More than 300 observers took part in the fieldwork. The extent of the coverage is tentatively estimated in 70-80 % of the birds actually present (the hinterland was not thoroughly surveyed but the number of birds involved are presumably small). Up to 565.831 birds were censured, 304.414 of which correspond to the Atlantic coast (approximately 2.300 Km of coastline), 212.321 to the Mediterranean coast (1.700 Km. of coastline) and 49.096 to inland areas. The regions most densely populated are Catalonia (23 % of the total), Galicia (19 %), Central Portugal (12,5 %) and Southwestern Andalucia (10.5 %). The most important areas are those of the Rias Bajas in Galicia (about 64.000 birds), the Tagus estuary (62.000), the Guadalquivir Maridmas (16.000), the Albufera of Valencia (26.000), the Ebro Delta (38.000), the Bay of Rosas (39.000), and the suburban areas around Madrid 32.000) and Barcelone (23.000). For the different species a brief review is made on its winter status in the extreme Southwestern Palearctic, by comparing this census with recent surveys carried out in Mediterranean France (ISENMANN, 1980), Italy (FASOLA, 1984), Algeria (JACOB, 1979) and Morocco (BEAUBRUN & THEVENOT, 1984). The Black-headed Gull (Larus ridibundus) is the most abundant species (accounting for 53% of the total numbers of birds). also being the most widely distributed and the only one which is common inland. The Herring Gull Yellow-legged Gull Larus argentatus/ cachinnans), which amounts to 102.160 birds in the Atlantic and 38.882 in the Mediterranean, comes directly afterwards. The number of this species seem to be consistent with recent estimates of the size of the Iberian breeding population (up to 47,7 % of the birds were censused in Galicia). The Lesser Blackbacked Gull (Larusfuscus) enters the Mediterranean (8.879 birds) as far as Barcelone, but remains much more common in the Atlantic (89.907 birds). It is specially abundant in low, sandy coasts, where the Herring Gull becomes scarce, as is the case for a major part of Portugal (26.880 birds in the Tagus estuary) and for Southwestern Andalucia. The importance of the wintering of the Mediterranean Gull (Larus melanocephalus) is worth mentioning: 18.279 were counted, most of them between Castellon and Barcelone, which constitutes the biggest wintering concentration yet recorded in the Mediterranean Sea. The Kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) numbers were clearly unusual (1.432 birds), this being related with the influx reported for the French, Iberian and Moroccan coasts during January and February of 1984. The other 9 gull species were reported in very low numbers. The observations of Slender-billed Gull (Larus genei), Audouin Gull (L audouinii), Iceland Gull (L. glaucoides) and Glaucous Gull (L. hyperboreus) are of interest since they have been rarely reported in winter in the Iberian Peninsula. The only common tern is the Sandwich Tern (Sterna sandvicensis), with 950 birds in the Atlantic coasts and 434 in the Mediterranean ones (not well surveyed for this species). The other three tern species are scarce.

P.",,"The growth of 20 nestling Common Kestrels (Falco tinnunculus) has been studied in Central Spain. The growth of body weight, tarsus and culmen was retarded when the feathers emerged coinciding with an intensification of the metabolic activity. These facts suggest that feather development needs great energy supply and restricts the energy delivered to other functions of biosynthesis. The variation of feather growth rate among individuals is very small and tends to be independent of the daily weight gain. In general, the higher the growth rate of the body weight, the greater the energy costs and the fledging weight. Nevertheless, the delay of the growth in adverse circumstances does not prevent the birds to obtain a normal fledging weight. Some possible interpretations of the differences between the growth rates of Iberian and mid-European Kestrels are discussed in relation to several ecological features of mediterranean and temperate ecosystems.",Central Spain; Falco tinnunculus; growth; nestlings.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/67.pdf,December 1985,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/322/articles/187-201/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

L.; SANTOS, T.",,"This paper analyzes the features of the distribution of passerines (crows excluded) wintering in the agricultural fields of Northern Spain (Basque Country and sourrounding regions; figure 1). This area is located on the boundary of the Eurosiberian (forested landscape with grass fields as dominant cultures) and Mediterranean (deforested landscape with cereal fields -Triticum, Hordeum- in the coldest areas and more diversified cultures cereals, vineyards and orchards in the more thermic sectors) bioclimatic regions. We have delimited 23 sectors where the bird communities have been censused by means of lie-transects and some agricultural-climatical gradients have been defined by means of a Principal Component Analysis (table I and figure 2). Factor I defines a thermic gradient opposing the Eurosiberian grassfields and the supramediterranean cereal fields on the hot and cold extremes respectively. Factor II defines a structural gradient ranging from the forested grassfields (associated with high precipitations) to the Mesomediterranean diversified cultures, through the cereal fields of the colder Supramediterranean sectors at higher elevations. In this factorial space, the 52 species of wintering birds have been situated in order to illustrate their mean winter distributions (figure 3). On the other hand, and to test the relationships among the species and the gradients defined by factors I and II, we have calculated the correlations between specific abundances of every sector and the factor scores of the sectors. Correlations with factors I and II are significant for 48 and 31%, respectively, of the bird species. A 55,8 % of the species (accounting for 85,9 % of the 35000 birds censused) have a significant multiple correlation with factors I and II, so that both gradients offer an adequate representation of the wintering bird patterns in the study area. The isopleths obtained from the distribution of abundance values (IKA) for insectivorous and granivorous species on the factorial space (figures 5,6 and 7), show a concentration of the former in the warmest sectors (according to the thermic exigences of their invertebrate preys). The greatest abundances for granivores are recorded in the coldest Mediterranean sectors, where cereal fields are the dominant landscape. In these sectors the high densities of some granivorous species (Alauda, Passer, Fringilla) are the main factor accounting for the entire regional patterns of variation in density (D), biomass (BM) and dominance (ID). Insectivores and granivores have distinct biological constraints that determine their different geographical patterns and strategies of local distribution (figure 8). The spatial aggregation of insectivorous species (measured as the coefficient of variation of their sectorial densities) shows a strong increase in the most unfavourable cold and deforested areas, while granivores have a spatial pattern much more homogeneous.",agricultural landscape; biogeography; climate; Northern Spain; Passeriformes; wintering communities.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/68.pdf,December 1985,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/322/articles/203-225/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ardeola,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/,1985,,Volume 32(2),,Wintering avifauna in the agricultural landscapes of northern Spain. II. The role of habitat structure and interspecific competition,,"CARRASCAL, L. M.; TELLERÍA, J. L.",,"This paper deals with the composition and structure of the wintering bird community in the agricultural areas of the Atlantic Basque Country and the habitat preferences of the species. To study this, 455 samples (0,2 ha) of the vegetation structure of the space occupied by 27 species have been taken (point centered count method of NOON, 1981a). Using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and considering weighted average data for each species (see Apendix), it has been found that the spatial niche is determined by 3 significant factors (table 1): structural complexity gradient (PCI), agricultural exploitation of the soil (PC2) and maturity of the hedges (PC3) (see figures 1 and 2 for the position of species in relation with these factors). Species abundance has no relation with habitat-width (table II). The relation between dominance and habitat-width proposed by McNAUGHTON and WOLF (1970) was not supported by our data. The strong interspecific overlap on PC1 and PC2 (especially among strictly wintering species), the lack of complementarity among the components of spatial niche and the fact that congeneric and morphologically very similar species do not overlap less than expected by chance (table III), suggest that competition does not determine the distribution of species. As a consequence of environment instability and adversity, outside and inside the area considered, the community is not saturated either for species or individuals. All these facts indicate that the bird communitty is not in equilibrium (in the sense of WIENS, 1984) and that its composition and structure is the result of species-specific habitat preferences. Correlating the position of species in a regional structural factor (F2 in TELLERIA and SANTOS, 1985) with their position on PC1 and PC2, it has been observed that local habitat preferences explain fairly well the regional distribution pattern (see figure 7).",agricultural areas; habitat preference; habitat-width; interspecific competition; northern Spain; Principal Component Analysis; wintering bird community.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/69.pdf,December 1985,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/322/articles/227-251/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ardeola,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/,1985,,Volume 32(2),,"The succession of bird communities in the plantations of Pinus sylvestris in the Ayllón massif (Sistema Central mountains, Spain)",,"POTTI, J.",,"This paper examines the bird composition and community structure of unplanted and afforested heaths in montane levels in the NE Sistema Central mountains. In order to study a succesional gradient, four stages of even-aged Scot pine growth were chosen, ranging from P-l (7 y. old; mean tree height 2.1 m.) through P-2 (25 y.; 5 m.) and P-3 (40 y.; 9 m.) to P-4 (100 y.; 14 m.). Birds were censused in these pinewoods and heath shrublands (brezal) with the line transect method in spring and winter. Community composition and bird densities (fig. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; Appendix) undergo profound changes in the succesional gradient, otherwise comparable to those already described in the European literature, being the most striking point the quick colonization and high dominances of the Coal Tit along the series. Turnover of avian species is greater during the winter (fig. 5), seemingly because of high seasonality that promotes community overlap in the spring. Accordingly, winter communities have lower mean niche (succesional amplitude) breadth values (fig. 6). Bird density and diversity increase in both spring and winter along the succesional series (table I), although in winter some differences between P-4 and earlier stages are not statistically significant. Both parameters increase from heathland to P-2, thereafter leveling off or decreasing in P-3 and increasing again in P-4. The P-2 pinewoods seem to behave in the mode described by earlier workers as a time ecotone responsable of the first peak in density and diversity. The second one occurs in the mature managed forest P-4 (also provided with nest boxes). The evenness component of diversity behaves similarly, although low sample sizes in winter due to very low densities precludes some seasonal and interhabitat comparisons. Mean individual weight in the community does not increase along the succesion but behaves erratically, seemingly because strong structural habitat correlates of this parameter. So does a measure of spring and winter similarity (table 1), although in this case the index is distinctly higher in the pinewoods as a whole than in the heath shrubland. Mediterranean and tropical migrant bird species decrease through the series despite their low importance in highlands and pinewoods. Granivorous, granivore-insectivorous birds and flycatchers peak at the same opposite extremes of the gradient. Succesional trends in guild structure follow the logical trends linked to the development of vegetation strata and hard substrates (trunk, branches) (table II). Guilds that forage in these parts are the less heavily affected by seasonality while the converse is true for ground insectivores. It is concluded that pine afforestation of heathlands in these mountains originates a very distinctive avifauna, denser and more diverse than that of heathlands. From a conservationist standpoint, however, some management recommendations (clearing, encouragement of deciduous undergrowth, erection of nest-boxes in earlier growth stages) are made regarding the low structural diversity of some plantations (e. g. P-3) and the general unsuitability of pinewoods for oak-living and tropical migrant bird species.",afforestation; bird communities; forestry management; heathlands; pinewoods; Spain; succesion.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/70.pdf,December 1985,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/322/articles/253-277/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Map figure 1, shows the previous known colonized area in Spain (A), and the new penetrated area (B). For the new area, see also figure 2 and table I. Until 1980, practically all the recorded observations in Iberia fall in the Euro-boreal zone of the Peninsula. After 1980, new records also occur inside the Iberian Mediterranean zone, both, in the Ebro Valley and Catalonia, as well as (this paper) in the Castilian Plateau. The colonizing of the Iberian Peninsula appears as the Western symmetrical counterpart of the much older South-east European and Anatolian range of the bird.. Reconsidering the nature of the expansion and demography of the bird in different latitudes and bio-climatic zones of the Western Palearctic, the authors conclude that, within the Iberian Peninsula the Collared Dove will never expand and densify as dramatically as it has done in the medium latitudes of Central and West Europe. In the interior of Spain, the Collared Dove appears established only in towns or cities, but not as yet in villages or small urban entities (see survey 1984-85 in table II). Habitat and behaviour in Iberia are similar to the rest of Europe. In the Castilian Plateau, single estrategic perennifoliate trees are the only roosting or nesting sites recorded. Such trees (see table I) may be important during the relative severe winters of the so-called supramediterranean zone of the Peninsula. Some possible or observed interrelations of the Collared Dove with the co-habitant avifauna, as well as some kind of suggested impacts on the antropogenic environment, are also discussed.",geographical expansion; Iberia; impact; Streptopelia decaocto.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/71.pdf,December 1985,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/322/articles/279-294/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The comparative study of skeletons belonging to 113 species of Passeriforms has lead us to the elaboration of identification keys based on skull osteological characters which present a variability due to the existence of different morphological patterns. These characters are: 1. Processus palatinus premaxillaris (p. p. pmx): BOCK (1960) established four morphotypes for this process within the Passeriformes: a) p. p. pmx lack (fig. 5A), b) p. p. pmx fused with the palatinum (fig. 5B), c) p. p. pmx free (fig. 5C) and d) p. p. pmx as a lateral flange (fig. 5D). 2. Foramen orbitonasale (f. on): We can establish two morphotypes: a) single f. on (fig. 6A-D) and b) a double f. on (fig. 6E-F). 3. Foramen venae occipitalis externae (f. v. o.): We can separate two different morphological patterns depending on the position of f. v. o in relation to the foramen magnum.. a) f. v. o included in the foramen magnum (fig. 7A) and b) f. v. o in a dorsal position to the foramen magnum (fig. 7B-C). 4. Fonticulum orbitale (f. or): Depending of the number we can establish two morphological types: a) one f. or (fig. 8A) and b) two t. or (fig. 8B-C). 5. Processus maxillopalatinus (p. mxp): We consider two morphotypes depending on where the brachium processi maxillopalatini joins the maxillary: a) p. mxp not visible from the upper-side (fig. 9A) and b) p. mxp visible from the upper-side (fig. 9B). Apart from the characters already mentioned, with a variability which responds to the existence of different morphological types, we have also considered a group of accidents; its presence or absence facilitates identification. This is the case of processus postorbitalis (p. po), processus coronoideus (p. c) and orbitospheniodale crests (cr. of). Although the postcranial features are not considered in the identification keys, a general diagnosis of them is made for each family, pointing out those peculiarities which characterize them best (figs. 12, 14, 18 and 34). Biometric data obtained from the measurements indicated on figures 3 and 4 are also given. These data have permited us, in occasions, to identify identical morphological species.

L.",,"This paper deals with the general features of the wintering of Passeriformes in the Iberian Peninsula in order to obtain a synthetic view of the different abundance patterns. We analyzed the data of twenty communities (woodlands, shrublands and cultivations) arranged through a latitudinal gradient encompassing the main bioclimatic levels of the Eurosiberian and Mediterranean regions. The influence of the climatic conditions was analyzed studying the relationships of the community structure with the autumn precipitations and the mean temperatures of January. Positive and significant correlations between density and temperature have been found in the communities wintering in natural habitats (woodlands and shrublands). These communities are arranged through a NNE-SSW gradient with the lowest densities in the supramediterranean level and the greastest ones in the oceanic mesomediterranean areas and the thermomediterranean levels of the southwest of Iberia. Thus, this territory is the most favourable as winter ground. These different densities are explained according to the seasonal productivity of the Mediterranean and Eurosiberian regions. Considering the peculiar role that both temperature and precipitacion have in these cycles of productivity, we suggest that the temperature is a representative index of the levels of food and subsequently of the carrying capacity of wintering birds in different Iberian areas, diversifying the role of precipitations in the Mediterranean region; in this region, the rains of autumn-winter are the primary factor explaining the characteristics of the winter productivity. Finally, we indicate the importance of the cultivations as wintering habitats for bird populations.",climatic gradients; geographical distribution; Iberian Peninsula; Passeriformes; wintering avifauna.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/51.pdf,June 1985,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/321/articles/17-30/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results are interpreted in view of several proposed hypotheses (MACARTHUR, 1959; HERRERA, 1978a; BILCKE, 1984).

The vegetation at the study site is composed of tall shrubs and small trees forming a closed canopy of 2.5-5 m high; it is dominated by plant species with fleshy fruits (56.8 % of woody species and 72 % horizontal cover). Variation in abundance and number of species of frugivorous passerines (mostly Sylvia spp., E. rubecula, Turdus spp. and Sturnus spp.) is extremely seasonal and closely associated to the annual cycle of ripe-fruit production by plants. The latter takes place between july and april-may, monthly fruit availability typically ranging form 0 to more than 105/Ha. mo. Frugivore abundance increases from 14.5 ind./10 Ha (july) to 94.2 (december) in 1981; during 1982 this seasonal change was from 19.2 (july) to 283.5 ind./10 Ha in january 1983. Frugivores as a group strongly influence the annual cycle of the whole community; at least during six months this group represents more than 50 % of the individuals recorded. Monthly variations of both species and abundance follow a recurrent pattern, closely related to the role of the shrublands as a passage area for transaharan migrants and a winter ground for other frugivores. The annual peaks of species turnover, diversity and abundance are related to these migratory phases. Winter densities are not significantly different between 1980-81 and 1981-82 but they show a marked increase from 1981-82 to 1982-83, this trend being widespread among the main species. Between-year variations in the abundance of frugivores are in relation to changes in the fruit supply. The distribution of wintering frugivores over continental Europe and their abundance patterns within the Iberian penninsula are considered with respect to the incidence of fleshy-fruited plant species in different vegetation types. The evolution of the annual cycle, with special reference to the circum-Mediterranean wintering, is discussed in connection with the between-year predictability of the fruit supply and other features derived from the mutualistic interaction between plants and the avian frugivores which act as seed dispersers.",annual cycle; frugivory; Passeriformes; sclerophyllous shrubland; South Spain.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/56.pdf,June 1985,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/321/articles/69-94/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

L.",,"This paper deals with an analysis of the use of space by eleven species of insectivorous birds that inhabit the forests of the Basque Country (Spain) during the winter. The species are: Regulus regulus, R. ignicapillus, Phylloscopus collybita, Parus ater, P. cristatus, P. caeruleus, P. palustris, P. major, Aegithalos caudatus, Certhia brachydactyla and Sitta europaea. Analyzing the use of 25 foraging categories by the species (table I) by means of Principal Component Analysis (PCA; table II) we have found four factors that account for 82,0% of the variance. The position on the horizontal axis of the tree together with the use of shrubs (PCI) and the selection of tree species (coniferous vs. deciduous; PC2) are the two most important factors shaping the spatial niche of the species. No complementarity has been found between the dimensions in table III, although supplementarity has been detected among substrates and the position on the vertical axis of the tree (AS and AEV in table III). Analyzing the mean overlap among the species in each foraging dimension (Figure 3), it has been observed that the use of tree parts and different tree species are the two most important niche axes segregating birds. Comparing the observed frecuential distributions of overlap with random simulations (neutral models; Figure 3), it has been found that species overlap less than expected by chance in tree species selection and in tree substrata. This fact is viewed as a consequence of interspecific competition. on the other hand, concerning the use of tree heights, species overlap more than expected by chance, possibly due to a strict response to the availability of substrata in the different tree heights; this indicates the low contribution, if any, of tree heights to the interspecific segregation. Finally the impact of forest management (deciduous trees falling and refforestation with Pinus radiata) on these species is analyzed.",Basque Country (Spain); forests; insectivorous birds; spatial niche: use of space; winter.,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/57.pdf,June 1985,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/321/articles/95-113/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This analysis has been made with the data in Nilsson and Alerstam (1976) for Lapland (Finland), and with the data collected by the author in the Sistema Central (Spain). The community (Table I) has a lower value of density and diversity in Lapland (Table II). Four guilds have been identified in the Sistema Central: ground searchers, pine seed eaters, trunk searchers and tree foliage-gleaners. The number of guilds is reduced to one in Lapland: a generalized tree-gleaning guild (Tables III and IV and Figure 1). These differences in the organization of the community are attributed to a less availability of food for birds in the pinewoods of the north latitudinal limit in relation to the subalpine forests in the Mediterranean region. The bird community in the Sistema Central has a lower value of niche breadth and overlap than the Lapland community. The total exploitation of feeding sites is less even in the Sistema Central (Table V and Figure 2).

The breeding birds in the eleven most extensive habitats (Table I) were censused by the frequential sampling method in 747 plots, yielding relative estimates of abundance and several indices of habitat and structural occupancy over the gradient (Table II). A Factorial Analysis performed on these data demonstrates that segregation of congeneric species in the group is achieved by means both of vegetation structure and altitude (Table III, Fig. 1). A second analysis centred on the evolution of the specific densities along two different continuous altitudinal gradients (forests of Holm oaks, Pyrenean oaks and Scots pines and shrublands of Cistus, Erica and Cytisus, respectively) shows the existence of altitudinal distributions consistent with Terborgh's (1971) model of distributions over gradients determined by physical and biological factors (Fig. 2). These patterns suggest the scarce importance of ecotones and competitive exclusion as determinants of the turdids distributions in these mountains even though both causes have been implicated to operate in other gradients (and in a related American guild). Results are interpreted in the light of the insular nature of these mountains for northern turdid species and of current views on the ecological relevance of competition in seasonal environments.",,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/42.pdf,June 1984,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/311/articles/103-113/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The food of the pair nesting by the edge of the marsh basically consists of aquatic birds, while the pairs nesting in isolated pine or cork-oak tree groves in the middle of scrub, eat rabbits and reptiles (Fig. 1). The outbreak of mixomatosis does not seem to have produced any functional response in the red kites breeders in Doñana, while on the other hand their number is steadily increasing.

C.",,"This study presents a comparative analysis of some basic reproductive parameters of the Spanish sparrow and the Rouse sparrow in Iberia. The dates for the initiation of the first clutches are nearly identical in both species. For both the interval between the laying of the first egg in two consecutive successful clutches is longer, the mean number of clutches per nest-season higher, but the synchronization is lower in the House sparrow. Therefore, the breeding season lasts longer for the House sparrow. The mean clucth size is 4.997 eggs in the Spanish sparrow and 4.87 eggs in the House sparrow, but the seasonal variation patterns of this parameter are very similar in both species. Losses of eggs are 31 .4 % in the Spanish sparrow and 25 % in the House sparrow, and nestling mortalities 47.8 % and 35.9 % respectively, the difference owing to the higher percentage of nest destruction and desertion in the former species as a consequence of their higher vulnerability. However, losses of eggs in successful clutches are higher to the House sparrow. The mean number of fledged young per successful nesting is 3.1 in both species, but the productivity is higher in the House sparrow (4.71 young fledged per nest-season) than in the Spanish sparrow (2.36). In addition, several aspects of the biology of the Spanish sparrow that may reduce the mortality rate in adults and juveniles are mentioned, and the relationships between the reproductive strategies of both species and the different environmental stabilities of their nesting babitats are discussed.",,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/21.pdf,June 1983,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/301/articles/3-21/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results, exposed in tables I and II, point out very high densities of birds. The peculiar bioclimatic features of this area explain these facts. Grasslands are the more seasonal habitat and support the highest densities of birds. Shrublands and cork-oak forests are much more impermeable habitats to wintering birds because they support more stable bird communities.

Stomach samples were obtained using tbe emetic method as modified by MOODY (1970). The results show that both species, A. arundinaceus and A. scirpaceus, are insectivorous. For the A. scirpaceus the most abundant prey were Coleopterous, Dipterous and Hymenopterous, and Coleopterous. Hymenoperous, Dipterous and Hemipteran for the A. arundinaceus. There was also a small contríbution of vegetal material and solid particles in the alimentary diet. The diet's structure was established using two parameters: frecuency and constancy, and can be classified into three groups. The Coleopterous were included in the first group of both species, A. arundinaceus and A. scirpaceus; Dipterous and Hymenopterous were included in the second group in A. arundinaceus, and these two orders and Hemipteran in A. scirpaceus.

No constant trends have been found in relation with the different conspicuousness among resources due to the recording techniques. As a consequence, overlap results are very similar as well. Results of all resources follow a regular distribution, and are statistically independent when the time between 2 consecutive records is higher than 30 seconds.

The community is made up of 14 species, with a value of H' 2.02 and 43.2 birds per 10 Has. Turdus iliacus is clearly dominant, representing 27.7 % of the total population density and 40.6 % of the biomass of the community. Five of the 14 species (67 %of the biomass) use holly significantly more than might be expected. This preference for holly is due to the scarcity of the habitat and involves winter dietary behaviour, temperature maintenance and refuge from predators. These factors are briefly discussed, together with the relation between the low food value of holly berries and their consumption by Turdus spp. and Garrulus, and that between the survival of T. iliacus and the dispersion of holly berries it effects.",,,https://www.ardeola.org/uploads/articles/docs/26.pdf,June 1983,,,https://www.ardeola.org/en/volumes/301/articles/65-76/,,,,,,,,,, Spanish,,,,,,,,,,,,,
