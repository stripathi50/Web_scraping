A threshold autoregressive (TAR) model was estimated using monthly series of international and producer prices of coffee and cocoa in Togo from 1994 to 2018. The results show that there is asymmetric transmission of international price shocks to producer prices. Domestic prices respond less quickly to international price increase than decreases. The asymmetric price transmission is similar in term of the speed of adjustment for the two commodities. In order to deal with this phenomenon, further investigations need to be done to detect the reasons for the asymmetry in price transmission between domestic and international coffee and cocoa markets.",,,https://afjare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/5.-Yovo-Adabe.pdf,"March 1, 2022",,,https://afjare.org/asymmetry-and-transmission-of-international-price-shocks-of-cocoa-and-coffee-in-togo/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This necessitates the need for livestock producers to respond to the growing demand. However, farmers’ efforts are aggravated by the effects of climate change.

The importance of this ecosystem service in improving agricultural production has largely been overlooked, however, in favour of practices that improve soil conditions such as fertiliser use and supplementary irrigation. Using economic modelling, this study estimates the value of insect pollination under different land-use types in Kenya. Our model assumes that a combination of land-use type and the foraging distance of insect pollinators influences the intensity of pollination and the value of agricultural output. To demonstrate the hypothesised relationships, areas under different land-use types, e. g. forest, grassland and cropland, and their distances from households were used as proxies for insect pollination. Concentric buffer zones representing foraging distances of pollinators from the land-use types were drawn at 250 m, 500 m, 1 000 m, 2 000 m and 3 000 m from the farms, and areas under each land use in the buffer zones were estimated for the years 2004, 2007 and 2010. Using the random-effects model and an output distance-function stochastic frontier model, the land-use areas, other factors of production and climate variables were regressed on the value of agricultural output in each buffer zone to determine their contribution to agricultural output resulting from insect pollination. The results indicate higher crop productivity on farms bordering forests and grasslands. This implies that insect pollinators are important for crop production, and increasing the number of pollinator habitats closer to the farms will increase food production in the tropics.",,,https://afjare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/6.-Mulwa-et-al.pdf,"June 1, 2022",,,https://afjare.org/influence-of-proximity-to-and-type-of-foraging-habitat-on-value-of-insect-pollination-in-the-tropics-with-applications-to-kenya/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Implications for value chain development,,Melinda Smale; Veronique Theriault; Andrea Allen; & Mamadou Sissoko,,"Cowpea, which is produced primarily in West Africa, is valued locally for its agronomic benefits in dryland farming, nutritional content, and contribution to the livelihoods of farming families. Many feel that more investment in cowpea research and development is needed for the crop to achieve its economic potential. Cowpea has long been labelled a ‘women’s crop’. We tested whether this is the case in Mali by exploring five indicators with a combination of primary and secondary databases, and interpreting our results in the context of the regional literature. We conclude that, in Mali, cowpea is better characterised as a ‘women’s enterprise’. Men are more likely than women to plant cowpea as either a primary or secondary crop and tend to plant larger areas, with cowpea intercropped. In drier agro-ecologies, women are more likely to grow cowpea than other crops. Although subsample sizes are very small, women cowpea growers appear to earn more on average from selling the harvest from their individual plots than do men.

Longer hours of farm work can potentially increase women’s time constraints, reducing the time allocated to child-caring responsibilities and raising the risk of poor child nutritional status. Using a three-wave household panel dataset from the Feed the Future Innovation Lab on Nutrition surveys in the north and southwest of Uganda, we tested the hypothesis that the negative effect of women’s agriculture time-use constraints on child stunting is mitigated for households that use labour or timesaving agricultural technologies (LSATs). The results show a positive and significant association between the number of hours per day that women spend on agricultural work and the risk of stunting in children aged zero to 23 months who live in households that do not use animal traction for ploughing. However, this association is statistically insignificant, and even turns negative for households that adopted the labour-saving technology. Our findings indicate that LSATs have the potential to lessen a household’s agricultural workload, giving mothers more child-caring time, and hence improving child nutritional status. Therefore, agriculture could have better nutritional outcomes if policies and programmes were designed to have interventions that reduce the workload in farming activities and thus reduce pressure on women’s time.",,,https://afjare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/6.-Namulondo-Bashaasha.pdf,"September 1, 2022",,,https://afjare.org/labour-saving-technologies-mitigate-the-effect-of-womens-agriculture-time-use-constraints-on-stunting-in-rural-uganda/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper we estimate the impact of the programme using high-quality household survey data from 2013/2014 and 2016/2017. Using the panel data, the double-difference model shows that households that borrow increase their stock of livestock. This is confirmed by the cross-section inverse probability-weighted regression adjustment models, which also find that VUP borrowing leads to more purchases of farm inputs, greater consumption (especially of home-produced food), lower poverty, and greater secondary school enrolment, but not to more hours worked. While VUP loans account for only 2% of the value of microcredit in Rwanda, they do help fill a need for production credit at a scale large enough to be able to help households appreciably increase their agricultural and other assets, and ultimately their income.",,,https://afjare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/4.-Habimana-Haughton.pdf,"September 1, 2022",,,https://afjare.org/does-rwandas-flagship-microcredit-programme-boost-agriculture-and-incomes/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has prompted the seed sector to introduce various varieties of climate-smart maize in Kenya and release them in the market. In contrast, there is little experiential insight into how the adoption of these varieties by small-scale farmers affects their household income. This paper used cross-sectional data to evaluate the implications of climate-smart maize varieties on small-scale farmers’ household income in Embu County in Kenya. The endogenous switching regression model was used to estimate the influence of climate-smart maize adoption on household income. Based on survey data obtained from 550 maize farmers in Embu County, the results show that age, education, land under climate-smart maize varieties, and distance to the market positively influenced the income level of the adopters. The findings further reveal that the decision to adopt the climate-smart maize varieties had a significant positive effect of about 60% on farmers’ household income. It therefore can be concluded from the results that the adopters would gain more from technology adoption. These results recommend policies that stimulate the adoption of current climate-smart varieties, with an emphasis on adoption by youths, to create more jobs and increase household income to reduce poverty among smallholder farmers in Kenya.",,,https://afjare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/3.-Wanjira-et-al.pdf,"September 1, 2022",,,https://afjare.org/impact-of-climate-smart-maize-varieties-on-household-income-among-smallholder-farmers-in-kenya-the-case-of-embu-county/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, for any technology or emerging agricultural practices, awareness and exposure are necessary conditions for their adoption. And because these two factors are not distributed randomly in the population of potential adopters, not taking them into account will lead to estimates of population adoption rates that are not informative of the true demand for the technology, and to inconsistent estimates of the parameters of the adoption model. In this study, we evaluate the adoption rates of ITTPF among farmers in Togo. Data was collected from 400 farmers in 2014, prior to the introduction of ITTPF, and again five years later.

Yet no study has systematically analysed this theme in Zimbabwe, an area that we address. Data was collected from 331 randomly selected farm households in four districts of Zimbabwe. Factor analysis was used to compute resilience capacities. Poisson regression was used for model estimations. Assets, market diversity and social capital increased dietary diversity by 7.5%, 3.6% and 2.9% respectively. Interventions that enhance asset accumulation, for example incomegenerating activities, should be promoted. Promoting farmer groups and collective actions are important to strengthen social capital. Adaptive and absorptive capacity increases dietary diversity by 5.9% and 5.4% respectively. Household resilience is positively associated with dietary diversity. The public and private sectors and civil society need to promote interventions that build adaptive, absorptive, and overall resilience capacity of farming households to enhance food security.",,,https://afjare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2.-Manyanga-et-al.pdf,"February 1, 2023",,,https://afjare.org/resilience-capacities-and-implications-for-food-security-in-zimbabwe/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence from poor households in Zambia,,Shun Chonabayashi; Theepakorn Jithitikulchai & Yeqing Qu,,"The adverse effects of weather extremes produce widespread damage and cause severe alterations in the normal functioning of household agricultural production in Zambia. Extreme weather events such as floods and drought are expected to increase in intensity and frequency due to climate change. Coupled with high poverty levels and limited institutional capacity, the country is highly vulnerable to the impact of extreme events. We quantify the effects of economic diversification on agricultural productivity of poor farm households with a skew-normal regression approach while accounting for drought and flood shocks. Our analysis finds that economic diversification is a strategy to increase agricultural productivity and mitigate the adverse impact of droughts and floods on agricultural households. The results also support the country’s policies to encourage hybrid maize production and to provide crop seeds and fertiliser to poor farmers.

However, the lack of market information may impede this development. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first paper to examine market information and preferences for soybean quality in a developing-world context. We seek to understand the nature of information markets associated with the nascent soybean trade in Sub-Saharan Africa in order to inform the market and policy of previously unknown key marketing information. The research involves a discrete choice experiment with 228 buyers of soybean involving five key soybean quality attributes. The sample represents three distinct classes of buyer/traders: wholesalers, processors and retailers. Traders significantly discount the price of soybean attributes such as off-colour, small grain size, low oil levels and high contamination with foreign material, such as stones. Foreign material ranks highest of the attributes that we examined, in terms of the discount level, at 22%. The study finds significant preference heterogeneity among traders, explained partly by the socioeconomic and trade characteristics of the respondents. We identified three distinct classes of traders per the latent class logit (LCL) results, namely ‘high price discounters’, ‘big bean supporters’, and ‘oil sceptics’. Our findings improve soybean market information, transparency and signalling.

Mixed sampling techniques (i. e. random, census and purposive) were applied to select sampling units. Descriptive statistics and the ordered logit model were used to analyse the data. This paper found that governance structures, opportunistic behaviour, asymmetric information and trust influence actors’ incentives in each functional node of the wheat value chain. Specifically, extension services, governance structures, power relations and price information have significant and positive effects on producers’ price incentives. The study provides pioneering evidence of the effects of governance structures on incentives in each functional node of the value chain.

Risk preference is modelled using a random linear utility framework defined over mean-standard deviation space. The study estimates expected revenue and revenue risk from the Just and Pope production function and applies the random parameter logit model to account for fisher-specific and location-specific characteristics. The findings are consistent with utility-maximising fishers, whereby the likelihood to choose a fishing location is positively associated with expected revenue and negatively related to revenue risk. Distance from fishing station to fishing grounds affects the choice of fishing location negatively. The estimated model allows heterogeneity in risk preferences and concludes that 51% of fishers can be classified as risk averse, 31% as risk seekers and the remaining as risk neutral. The study also estimates the degree of substitutability and complementarity between fishing locations based on the risk preferences of fishers and discusses the relevance of this for fisheries management policy.",,,https://afjare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/5.-Sultan.pdf,"June 1, 2020",,,https://afjare.org/fishing-location-choice-and-risk-preferences-among-small-fishers-implications-for-fisheries-management-policies/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using household-level panel data collected from Ethiopia, we estimated the effects of crop diversification through maize-legume intercropping/rotation on maize yield distribution and downside risk. Results from endogenous switching regression models and quintile moment approaches show that plots with maize-legume intercropping/rotation have the highest average maize yield. Such crop diversification reduces the downside risk in maize yield more when applied to plots receiving external inputs. The results imply that, in addition to the technical support around external input use in smallholder maize production, Ethiopia’s agricultural extension may also need to give due emphasis to both spatial and temporal crop diversification practices. This could enhance crop productivity further and reduce the potential downside risks typically hampering smallholders’ external input use in maize production.",,,https://afjare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2.-Jaleta-et-al.pdf,"June 1, 2020",,,https://afjare.org/does-crop-diversification-reduce-downside-risk-of-external-maize-yield-enhancing-technology-evidence-from-ethiopia/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is a dearth of empirical insights into consumer preferences for this critical aspect in the domestic markets of developing countries. The current study analysed consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for fair-trade attributes in the goat meat value chain in Nairobi, Kenya. Choice experiment data from 270 randomly sampled consumers was analysed using the random parameter logit (RPL) model. The results show that 56% of the consumers were aware of the fair-trade concept and 64% of them were willing to pay for fair-trade-compliant practices. Specifically, consumers were willing to pay a premium of 62% to prevent child labour, 45% to support provision of medical insurance for workers in the meat value chain, 40% for direct purchase from producers, 39% for fair-trade labelling and 30% to support disabled people as part of corporate social responsibility.",,,https://afjare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/7.-Otieno.pdf,"December 1, 2020",,,https://afjare.org/consumer-willingness-to-pay-for-fair-trade-attributes-of-goat-meat-in-kenya-a-choice-experiment-analysis/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Babu,,"There is a significant soybean yield gap in sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. Sustainable intensification of the agricultural sector to reduce such a yield gap is important. Increasing soybean productivity can meet the growing demand for food and feed when complemented with higher soy meal demand by the local livestock industry. This study performs an ex-ante economic analysis to determine the effect of higher soybean production on trade and land use within SSA countries. We find that increasing soybean yield by 50% can increase the total returns from soybean production by 186 million LC (local currency) in Ethiopia and 36 billion LC in Nigeria. We show that soybean yield growth alone is enough to boost soy oil production, as the crushing of the beans produces 18% oil and 79% meal. While increasing productivity may lead to freeing land to produce high-valued cash crops, investors will be reluctant to invest in the crushing facilities in the absence of soy meal demand by the livestock industry. Therefore, policymakers need to establish collaboration between development organisations, private companies, farmers and researchers to achieve this transformation and thereby raise agricultural productivity.",,,https://afjare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/6.-Debnath-Babu.pdf,"December 1, 2020",,,https://afjare.org/prospects-for-sustainable-intensification-of-soybean-production-in-sub-saharan-africa/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Domestic wheat markets in Kenya were found to be strongly integrated while, international wheat markets were cointegrated with domestic prices at the port of Mombasa. The long-run elasticity of price transmission was estimated at 0.91, which implies that 91% of the changes in international wheat prices are transmitted to domestic markets in Kenya. The speed of adjustment was estimated at -0.069, which implies that it takes about 14 months for the changes in the international wheat price to be fully transmitted to the Kenyan domestic market. Wheat farmers in Kenya seem to be insulated from international price shocks given the long period of time it takes for domestic markets to adjust to international price changes. Even though not explicitly analysed, government border policies, market and infrastructure impediments seem to be underlying causes of the incomplete price pass-through, along with the low speeds of adjustments. Our analysis suggests that the main constraint to a complete pass-through is the existence of price-setting power at the producer level of the wheat market in Kenya.

Evidence from Kenya,,Josiah Ateka; Perez Ayieko Onono-Okelo & Martin Etyang,,"The inverse farm size and productivity relationship (IR) is a recurring theme in the literature. However, most previous studies were undertaken within a setting of mixed cropping systems. In this article, we investigate the effect of farm size on productivity within the context of a perennial mono-cropping system, acute competition for farmland, frequent subdivision of farms and declining yields. We apply household survey data of smallholder tea farms in western Kenya and consider both technical efficiency (TE) and the yield per hectare as indicators of productivity. The findings show that the effect of farm size on productivity is nonlinear, with TE initially declining and then rising with farm size. The findings also demonstrate that the farm size and productivity relationship is important for perennial monocrops and that the use of robust measures of productivity is important for the IR. The findings have important implications for agricultural policy in developing countries.",,,https://afjare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/4.-Ateka-et-al.pdf,"September 1, 2021",,,https://afjare.org/does-the-inverse-farm-size-productivity-hypothesis-hold-for-perennial-monocrop-systems-in-developing-countries-evidence-from-kenya/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of adopting modern agricultural inputs on household welfare in Rwanda,,Aimable Nsabimana,,"This study investigates the driving factors that influence farmers’ decisions to adopt modern agricultural inputs (MAI) and how this affects farm household welfare in rural Rwanda. To account for heterogeneity in the MAI adoption decision and unobservable farm and household attributes, we estimate an endogenous switching regression (ESR) model. The findings reveal that size of land endowment, access to farm credit and awareness of farm advisory services are the main driving forces behind MAI adoption. The analysis further shows that MAI adoption increases household farm income, farm yield and equivalised consumption per capita. This implies that adopting MAI is the most consistent and potentially best pathway to reduce poverty among rural farmers. The study hence suggests that policymakers should align the effective dissemination of MAI information and farm advisory services, strengthen farm credit systems and improve market access – most crucially at affordable prices – among small-farmers throughout Rwanda.",,,https://afjare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/3.-Nsabimana.pdf,"September 1, 2021",,,https://afjare.org/is-change-worth-it-the-effects-of-adopting-modern-agricultural-inputs-on-household-welfare-in-rwanda/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mills,,"Weather is an important determinant of household well-being in rural Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper explores the relationship between novel measures of cropping-season weather conditions and household food consumption in rural Niger, and how household coping mechanisms mediate that relationship. We employ a panel logit model to show that the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and extreme heat degree day (EHDD) measures are associated with subjective self-reporting of drought in a panel dataset of 2 264 households. We then show, with a household fixed-effects panel model, that low NDVI and high EHDD measures are associated with significant decreases in household per capita food consumption. Household coping strategies, such as the disbursement of savings, temporary migration of a family member, and the adoption of heat-resistant agricultural technologies, are found to partially mitigate, but not fully alleviate, the negative effects of weather shocks on consumption. More comprehensive coping mechanisms are needed to improve household resilience to weather shocks.",,,https://afjare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2.-Gao-and-Mills.pdf,"September 1, 2021",,,https://afjare.org/influence-of-weather-shocks-and-coping-strategies-on-food-consumption-evidence-from-rural-niger/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study employs the vector error correction modelling (VECM) technique, and the estimate shows that government expenditure on the agricultural sector had the most significant effect on agricultural productivity, followed by commercial bank credit for the agricultural sector. Also, the study found that public expenditure (proxied by government expenditure on the agricultural sector) and private investment (proxied by commercial bank credit for the agricultural sector) are complementary investments in promoting agricultural productivity, while public expenditure on the agricultural sector and foreign direct investment are substitute investments. The study recommends that budgetary allocation to the agricultural sector should be increased, and that commercial banks should be strengthened through the monetary authority by advancing more loans to agricultural businessmen and businesswomen at a reduced lending rate.",,,https://afjare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/1.-Nwosa.pdf,"September 1, 2021",,,https://afjare.org/complement-or-substitute-private-investment-public-expenditure-and-agricultural-productivity-in-nigeria/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analysed price volatility using the generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH(1,1)) modelling technique. This econometric technique was applied to market-level time-series data from selected major markets in Ghana from 2006 to 2015. The results indicate that price volatility for maize and rice has declined in the long run and, in the short run, shows relatively slow volatility transmission. The findings show that the buffer stockholding operations policy in the selected markets has stabilised the prices of the two commodities, especially in the long run. The results suggest that buffer stockholding operation policy remains a viable alternative for curbing high price volatility if structured well to fit the country context. We also conclude that climate change resilience measures are needed to be integrated into the agriculture and food systems of the country if we want to address the persistent price volatility of maize and rice in Ghana sustainably.",,,https://afjare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/6.-Abokyi-Asiedu.pdf,"December 1, 2021",,,https://afjare.org/agricultural-policy-and-commodity-price-stabilisation-in-ghana-the-role-of-buffer-stockholding-operations/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We employ a linear model on cross-sectional data collected from October to December 2015, with the preceding 12 months as the reference period. The data was from 835 smallholder farmers in Kenya to assess the effect of farmer empowerment in agriculture on farm income. This is a departure from numerous previous studies, which considered the intra-household empowerment of women relative to men on the assumption that men are empowered, which may not always be the case – as we show in this study. The results show that farmer empowerment in agriculture increases per capita farm incomes. Unlike male farmers, who benefit from the overall empowerment in agriculture, female farmers do not, possibly due to constraints in complementary drivers of farm income such as access to productive resources. Interestingly, improving the income domain for female farmers increases their farm incomes more than for their male counterparts. We conclude that farmer empowerment in agriculture is a necessary driver of farm incomes, with the production, leadership and income domains being the viable impact pathways. Thus, development interventions should target specific empowerment domains while controlling for sex differences among the target farmers.",,,https://afjare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/5.-Mwololo-et-al.pdf,"December 1, 2021",,,https://afjare.org/farmer-empowerment-in-agriculture-and-its-association-with-smallholder-farm-incomes-in-kenya/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Growing empirical evidence suggests that there is a positive link, but that not all empowerment dimensions influence nutritional outcomes. Using longitudinal data from the Nigeria Living Standards Measurement Study – Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA), covering the period from 2010 to 2016, specific evidence on this topic is provided. Our findings show no relationship between women’s empowerment as measured by women who own agricultural land and have access to credit, and their caloric energy intake. Nevertheless, if women jointly own land and other agricultural inputs with their spouse, it has a positive influence on their caloric energy intake. The children’s anthropometric scores responded positively to women’s empowerment indicators, although with differential effects for boys and girls. Women’s access to agricultural inputs and land rights are necessary conditions for maximising the potential benefits derived from the women-empowerment-nutrition link. Improvements in the anthropometric scores of girl children of empowered women should be considered a priority for intervention programmes.",,,https://afjare.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/3.-Aderemi.pdf,"December 1, 2021",,,https://afjare.org/nutritional-deficiency-and-womens-empowerment-in-agriculture-evidence-from-nigeria/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
